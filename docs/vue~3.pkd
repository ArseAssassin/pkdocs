  summary: Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
  description: "# Introduction\n\n**You are reading the documentation for Vue 3!**\n\n- Vue 2 support has ended on **Dec 31, 2023**. Learn more about [Vue 2 EOL](https://v2.vuejs.org/eol/).\n- Upgrading from Vue 2? Check out the [Migration Guide](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/).\n\n## What is Vue?\n\nVue (pronounced /vjuː/, like **view**) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex.\n\nHere is a minimal example:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\ncreateApp({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n}).mount('#app')\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp, ref } from 'vue'\n\ncreateApp({\n  setup() {\n    return {\n      count: ref(0)\n    }\n  }\n}).mount('#app')\n```\n\n``` template\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <button @click=\"count++\">\n    Count is: {{ count }}\n  </button>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Result**\n\nThe above example demonstrates the two core features of Vue:\n\n- **Declarative Rendering**: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.\n\n- **Reactivity**: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.\n\nYou may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every little detail in the rest of the documentation. For now, please read along so you can have a high-level understanding of what Vue offers.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\nThe rest of the documentation assumes basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics and then come back! You can check your knowledge level with these overviews for [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) if needed. Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.\n\n## The Progressive Framework\n\nVue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common features needed in frontend development. But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways:\n\n- Enhancing static HTML without a build step\n- Embedding as Web Components on any page\n- Single-Page Application (SPA)\n- Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n- Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)\n- Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal\n\nIf you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial and guide only require basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge, and you should be able to follow along without being an expert in any of these.\n\nIf you are an experienced developer interested in how to best integrate Vue into your stack, or you are curious about what these terms mean, we discuss them in more detail in [Ways of Using Vue](extras/ways-of-using-vue).\n\nDespite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is shared across all these use cases. Even if you are just a beginner now, the knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you grow to tackle more ambitious goals in the future. If you are a veteran, you can pick the optimal way to leverage Vue based on the problems you are trying to solve, while retaining the same productivity. This is why we call Vue \"The Progressive Framework\": it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt to your needs.\n\n## Single-File Components\n\nIn most build-tool-enabled Vue projects, we author Vue components using an HTML-like file format called **Single-File Component** (also known as `*.vue` files, abbreviated as **SFC**). A Vue SFC, as the name suggests, encapsulates the component's logic (JavaScript), template (HTML), and styles (CSS) in a single file. Here's the previous example, written in SFC format:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"count++\">Count is: {{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\nbutton {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nconst count = ref(0)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"count++\">Count is: {{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\nbutton {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nSFC is a defining feature of Vue and is the recommended way to author Vue components **if** your use case warrants a build setup. You can learn more about the [how and why of SFC](scaling-up/sfc) in its dedicated section - but for now, just know that Vue will handle all the build tools setup for you.\n\n## API Styles\n\nVue components can be authored in two different API styles: **Options API** and **Composition API**.\n\n### Options API\n\nWith Options API, we define a component's logic using an object of options such as `data`, `methods`, and `mounted`. Properties defined by options are exposed on `this` inside functions, which points to the component instance:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  // Properties returned from data() become reactive state\n  // and will be exposed on `this`.\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n\n  // Methods are functions that mutate state and trigger updates.\n  // They can be bound as event handlers in templates.\n  methods: {\n    increment() {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  },\n\n  // Lifecycle hooks are called at different stages\n  // of a component's lifecycle.\n  // This function will be called when the component is mounted.\n  mounted() {\n    console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">Count is: {{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNptkMFqxCAQhl9lkB522ZL0HNKlpa/Qo4e1ZpLIGhUdl5bgu9es2eSyIMio833zO7NP56pbRNawNkivHJ25wV9nPUGHvYiaYOYGoK7Bo5CkbgiBBOFy2AkSh2N5APmeojePCkDaaKiBt1KnZUuv3Ky0PppMsyYAjYJgigu0oEGYDsirYUAP0WULhqVrQhptF5qHQhnpcUJD+wyQaSpUd/Xp9NysVY/yT2qE0dprIS/vsds5Mg9mNVbaDofL94jZpUgJXUKBCvAy76ZUXY53CTd5tfX2k7kgnJzOCXIF0P5EImvgQ2olr++cbRE4O3+t6JxvXj0ptXVpye1tvbFY+ge/NJZt)\n\n### Composition API\n\nWith Composition API, we define a component's logic using imported API functions. In SFCs, Composition API is typically used with [`<script setup>`](../api/sfc-script-setup). The `setup` attribute is a hint that makes Vue perform compile-time transforms that allow us to use Composition API with less boilerplate. For example, imports and top-level variables / functions declared in `<script setup>` are directly usable in the template.\n\nHere is the same component, with the exact same template, but using Composition API and `<script setup>` instead:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\n// reactive state\nconst count = ref(0)\n\n// functions that mutate state and trigger updates\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}\n\n// lifecycle hooks\nonMounted(() => {\n  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">Count is: {{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpNkMFqwzAQRH9lMYU4pNg9Bye09NxbjzrEVda2iLwS0spQjP69a+yYHnRYad7MaOfiw/tqSliciybqYDxDRE7+qsiM3gWGGQJ2r+DoyyVivEOGLrgRDkIdFCmqa1G0ms2EELllVKQdRQa9AHBZ+PLtuEm7RCKVd+ChZRjTQqwctHQHDqbvMUDyd7mKip4AGNIBRyQujzArgtW/mlqb8HRSlLcEazrUv9oiDM49xGGvXgp5uT5his5iZV1f3r4HFHvDprVbaxPhZf4XkKub/CDLaep1T7IhGRhHb6WoTADNT2KWpu/aGv24qGKvrIrr5+Z7hnneQnJu6hURvKl3ryL/ARrVkuI=)\n\n### Which to Choose?\n\nBoth API styles are fully capable of covering common use cases. They are different interfaces powered by the exact same underlying system. In fact, the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API! The fundamental concepts and knowledge about Vue are shared across the two styles.\n\nThe Options API is centered around the concept of a \"component instance\" (`this` as seen in the example), which typically aligns better with a class-based mental model for users coming from OOP language backgrounds. It is also more beginner-friendly by abstracting away the reactivity details and enforcing code organization via option groups.\n\nThe Composition API is centered around declaring reactive state variables directly in a function scope and composing state from multiple functions together to handle complexity. It is more free-form and requires an understanding of how reactivity works in Vue to be used effectively. In return, its flexibility enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic.\n\nYou can learn more about the comparison between the two styles and the potential benefits of Composition API in the [Composition API FAQ](extras/composition-api-faq).\n\nIf you are new to Vue, here's our general recommendation:\n\n- For learning purposes, go with the style that looks easier to understand to you. Again, most of the core concepts are shared between the two styles. You can always pick up the other style later.\n\n- For production use:\n\n  - Go with Options API if you are not using build tools, or plan to use Vue primarily in low-complexity scenarios, e.g. progressive enhancement.\n\n  - Go with Composition API + Single-File Components if you plan to build full applications with Vue.\n\nYou don't have to commit to only one style during the learning phase. The rest of the documentation will provide code samples in both styles where applicable, and you can toggle between them at any time using the **API Preference switches** at the top of the left sidebar.\n\n## Still Got Questions?\n\nCheck out our [FAQ](https://vuejs.org/about/faq).\n\n## Pick Your Learning Path\n\nDifferent developers have different learning styles. Feel free to pick a learning path that suits your preference - although we do recommend going over all of the content, if possible!\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction)"

  summary: To quickly get a taste of Vue, you can try it directly in our Playground
  description: "# Quick Start\n\n## Try Vue Online\n\n- To quickly get a taste of Vue, you can try it directly in our [Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jcEKwjAMhl/lt5fpQYfXUQfefAMvvRQbddC1pUuHUPrudg4HIcmXjyRZXEM4zYlEJ+T0iEPgXjn6BB8Zhp46WUZWDjCa9f6w9kAkTtH9CRinV4fmRtZ63H20Ztesqiylphqy3R5UYBqD1UyVAPk+9zkvV1CKbCv9poMLiTEfR2/IXpSoXomqZLtti/IFwVtA9A==).\n\n- If you prefer a plain HTML setup without any build steps, you can use this [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/yyx990803/2ke1ab0z/) as your starting point.\n\n- If you are already familiar with Node.js and the concept of build tools, you can also try a complete build setup right within your browser on [StackBlitz](https://vite.new/vue).\n\n## Creating a Vue Application\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n- Familiarity with the command line\n- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.0 or higher\n\nIn this section we will introduce how to scaffold a Vue [Single Page Application](extras/ways-of-using-vue#single-page-application-spa) on your local machine. The created project will be using a build setup based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and allow us to use Vue [Single-File Components](scaling-up/sfc) (SFCs).\n\nMake sure you have an up-to-date version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed and your current working directory is the one where you intend to create a project. Run the following command in your command line (without the `$` sign):\n\nnpm\n\npnpm\n\nyarn\n\nbun\n\n``` sh\n$ npm create vue@latest\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ pnpm create vue@latest\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ yarn create vue@latest\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ bun create vue@latest\n```\n\nThis command will install and execute [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), the official Vue project scaffolding tool. You will be presented with prompts for several optional features such as TypeScript and testing support:\n\n``` sh\n✔ Project name: … <your-project-name>\n✔ Add TypeScript? … No / Yes\n✔ Add JSX Support? … No / Yes\n✔ Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? … No / Yes\n✔ Add Pinia for state management? … No / Yes\n✔ Add Vitest for Unit testing? … No / Yes\n✔ Add an End-to-End Testing Solution? … No / Cypress / Playwright\n✔ Add ESLint for code quality? … No / Yes\n✔ Add Prettier for code formatting? … No / Yes\n\nScaffolding project in ./<your-project-name>...\nDone.\n```\n\nIf you are unsure about an option, simply choose `No` by hitting enter for now. Once the project is created, follow the instructions to install dependencies and start the dev server:\n\nnpm\n\npnpm\n\nyarn\n\nbun\n\n``` sh\n$ cd <your-project-name>\n$ npm install\n$ npm run dev\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ cd <your-project-name>\n$ pnpm install\n$ pnpm run dev\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ cd <your-project-name>\n$ yarn\n$ yarn dev\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ cd <your-project-name>\n$ bun install\n$ bun run dev\n```\n\nYou should now have your first Vue project running! Note that the example components in the generated project are written using the [Composition API](introduction#composition-api) and `<script setup>`, rather than the [Options API](introduction#options-api). Here are some additional tips:\n\n- The recommended IDE setup is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar). If you use other editors, check out the [IDE support section](scaling-up/tooling#ide-support).\n- More tooling details, including integration with backend frameworks, are discussed in the [Tooling Guide](scaling-up/tooling).\n- To learn more about the underlying build tool Vite, check out the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev).\n- If you choose to use TypeScript, check out the [TypeScript Usage Guide](typescript/overview).\n\nWhen you are ready to ship your app to production, run the following:\n\nnpm\n\npnpm\n\nyarn\n\nbun\n\n``` sh\n$ npm run build\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ pnpm run build\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ yarn build\n```\n\n``` sh\n$ bun run build\n```\n\nThis will create a production-ready build of your app in the project's `./dist` directory. Check out the [Production Deployment Guide](best-practices/production-deployment) to learn more about shipping your app to production.\n\n[Next Steps \\>](#next-steps)\n\n## Using Vue from CDN\n\nYou can use Vue directly from a CDN via a script tag:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js\"></script>\n```\n\nHere we are using [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/), but you can also use any CDN that serves npm packages, for example [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/vue) or [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/vue). Of course, you can also download this file and serve it yourself.\n\nWhen using Vue from a CDN, there is no \"build step\" involved. This makes the setup a lot simpler, and is suitable for enhancing static HTML or integrating with a backend framework. However, you won't be able to use the Single-File Component (SFC) syntax.\n\n### Using the Global Build\n\nThe above link loads the *global build* of Vue, where all top-level APIs are exposed as properties on the global `Vue` object. Here is a full example using the global build:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js\"></script>\n\n<div id=\"app\">{{ message }}</div>\n\n<script>\n  const { createApp } = Vue\n\n  createApp({\n    data() {\n      return {\n        message: 'Hello Vue!'\n      }\n    }\n  }).mount('#app')\n</script>\n```\n\n[Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/QWJwJLp)\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js\"></script>\n\n<div id=\"app\">{{ message }}</div>\n\n<script>\n  const { createApp, ref } = Vue\n\n  createApp({\n    setup() {\n      const message = ref('Hello vue!')\n      return {\n        message\n      }\n    }\n  }).mount('#app')\n</script>\n```\n\n[Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/eYQpQEG)\n\n**TIP**\n\nMany of the examples for Composition API throughout the guide will be using the `<script setup>` syntax, which requires build tools. If you intend to use Composition API without a build step, consult the usage of the [`setup()` option](../api/composition-api-setup).\n\n### Using the ES Module Build\n\nThroughout the rest of the documentation, we will be primarily using [ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) syntax. Most modern browsers now support ES modules natively, so we can use Vue from a CDN via native ES modules like this:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"app\">{{ message }}</div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import { createApp } from 'https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js'\n\n  createApp({\n    data() {\n      return {\n        message: 'Hello Vue!'\n      }\n    }\n  }).mount('#app')\n</script>\n```\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"app\">{{ message }}</div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import { createApp, ref } from 'https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js'\n\n  createApp({\n    setup() {\n      const message = ref('Hello Vue!')\n      return {\n        message\n      }\n    }\n  }).mount('#app')\n</script>\n```\n\nNotice that we are using `<script type=\"module\">`, and the imported CDN URL is pointing to the **ES modules build** of Vue instead.\n\n[Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/VwVYVZO)\n\n[Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/MWzazEv)\n\n### Enabling Import maps\n\nIn the above example, we are importing from the full CDN URL, but in the rest of the documentation you will see code like this:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n```\n\nWe can teach the browser where to locate the `vue` import by using [Import Maps](https://caniuse.com/import-maps):\n\n``` html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n  {\n    \"imports\": {\n      \"vue\": \"https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js\"\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<div id=\"app\">{{ message }}</div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\n  createApp({\n    data() {\n      return {\n        message: 'Hello Vue!'\n      }\n    }\n  }).mount('#app')\n</script>\n```\n\n[Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/wvQKQyM)\n\n``` html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n  {\n    \"imports\": {\n      \"vue\": \"https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js\"\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<div id=\"app\">{{ message }}</div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'\n\n  createApp({\n    setup() {\n      const message = ref('Hello Vue!')\n      return {\n        message\n      }\n    }\n  }).mount('#app')\n</script>\n```\n\n[Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/YzRyRYM)\n\nYou can also add entries for other dependencies to the import map - but make sure they point to the ES modules version of the library you intend to use.\n\n**Import Maps Browser Support**\n\nImport Maps is a relatively new browser feature. Make sure to use a browser within its [support range](https://caniuse.com/import-maps). In particular, it is only supported in Safari 16.4+.\n\n**Notes on Production Use**\n\nThe examples so far are using the development build of Vue - if you intend to use Vue from a CDN in production, make sure to check out the [Production Deployment Guide](best-practices/production-deployment#without-build-tools).\n\n### Splitting Up the Modules\n\nAs we dive deeper into the guide, we may need to split our code into separate JavaScript files so that they are easier to manage. For example:\n\n``` html\n<!-- index.html -->\n<div id=\"app\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import { createApp } from 'vue'\n  import MyComponent from './my-component.js'\n\n  createApp(MyComponent).mount('#app')\n</script>\n```\n\n``` js\n// my-component.js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return { count: 0 }\n  },\n  template: `<div>count is {{ count }}</div>`\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// my-component.js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n    return { count }\n  },\n  template: `<div>count is {{ count }}</div>`\n}\n```\n\nIf you directly open the above `index.html` in your browser, you will find that it throws an error because ES modules cannot work over the `file://` protocol, which is the protocol the browser uses when you open a local file.\n\nDue to security reasons, ES modules can only work over the `http://` protocol, which is what the browsers use when opening pages on the web. In order for ES modules to work on our local machine, we need to serve the `index.html` over the `http://` protocol, with a local HTTP server.\n\nTo start a local HTTP server, first make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then run `npx serve` from the command line in the same directory where your HTML file is. You can also use any other HTTP server that can serve static files with the correct MIME types.\n\nYou may have noticed that the imported component's template is inlined as a JavaScript string. If you are using VSCode, you can install the [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) extension and prefix the strings with a `/*html*/` comment to get syntax highlighting for them.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf you skipped the [Introduction](introduction), we strongly recommend reading it before moving on to the rest of the documentation.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start)"
- name: 3. Creating a Vue Application  (Essentials)
  id: guide/essentials/application
  summary: The object we are passing into createApp is in fact a component
  description: "# Creating a Vue Application\n\n## The application instance\n\nEvery Vue application starts by creating a new **application instance** with the [`createApp`](../../api/application#createapp) function:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({\n  /* root component options */\n})\n```\n\n## The Root Component\n\nThe object we are passing into `createApp` is in fact a component. Every app requires a \"root component\" that can contain other components as its children.\n\nIf you are using Single-File Components, we typically import the root component from another file:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n// import the root component App from a single-file component.\nimport App from './App.vue'\n\nconst app = createApp(App)\n```\n\nWhile many examples in this guide only need a single component, most real applications are organized into a tree of nested, reusable components. For example, a Todo application's component tree might look like this:\n\n``` \nApp (root component)\n├─ TodoList\n│  └─ TodoItem\n│     ├─ TodoDeleteButton\n│     └─ TodoEditButton\n└─ TodoFooter\n   ├─ TodoClearButton\n   └─ TodoStatistics\n```\n\nIn later sections of the guide, we will discuss how to define and compose multiple components together. Before that, we will focus on what happens inside a single component.\n\n## Mounting the App\n\nAn application instance won't render anything until its `.mount()` method is called. It expects a \"container\" argument, which can either be an actual DOM element or a selector string:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"app\"></div>\n```\n\n``` js\napp.mount('#app')\n```\n\nThe content of the app's root component will be rendered inside the container element. The container element itself is not considered part of the app.\n\nThe `.mount()` method should always be called after all app configurations and asset registrations are done. Also note that its return value, unlike the asset registration methods, is the root component instance instead of the application instance.\n\n### In-DOM Root Component Template\n\nThe template for the root component is usually part of the component itself, but it is also possible to provide the template separately by writing it directly inside the mount container:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <button @click=\"count++\">{{ count }}</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n})\n\napp.mount('#app')\n```\n\nVue will automatically use the container's `innerHTML` as the template if the root component does not already have a `template` option.\n\nIn-DOM templates are often used in applications that are [using Vue without a build step](../quick-start#using-vue-from-cdn). They can also be used in conjunction with server-side frameworks, where the root template might be generated dynamically by the server.\n\n## App Configurations\n\nThe application instance exposes a `.config` object that allows us to configure a few app-level options, for example, defining an app-level error handler that captures errors from all descendant components:\n\n``` js\napp.config.errorHandler = (err) => {\n  /* handle error */\n}\n```\n\nThe application instance also provides a few methods for registering app-scoped assets. For example, registering a component:\n\n``` js\napp.component('TodoDeleteButton', TodoDeleteButton)\n```\n\nThis makes the `TodoDeleteButton` available for use anywhere in our app. We will discuss registration for components and other types of assets in later sections of the guide. You can also browse the full list of application instance APIs in its [API reference](../../api/application).\n\nMake sure to apply all app configurations before mounting the app!\n\n## Multiple application instances\n\nYou are not limited to a single application instance on the same page. The `createApp` API allows multiple Vue applications to co-exist on the same page, each with its own scope for configuration and global assets:\n\n``` js\nconst app1 = createApp({\n  /* ... */\n})\napp1.mount('#container-1')\n\nconst app2 = createApp({\n  /* ... */\n})\napp2.mount('#container-2')\n```\n\nIf you are using Vue to enhance server-rendered HTML and only need Vue to control specific parts of a large page, avoid mounting a single Vue application instance on the entire page. Instead, create multiple small application instances and mount them on the elements they are responsible for.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application)"

  summary: Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying component instance's data
  description: "# Template Syntax\n\nVue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying component instance's data. All Vue templates are syntactically valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers.\n\nUnder the hood, Vue compiles the templates into highly-optimized JavaScript code. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue can intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.\n\nIf you are familiar with Virtual DOM concepts and prefer the raw power of JavaScript, you can also [directly write render functions](../extras/render-function) instead of templates, with optional JSX support. However, do note that they do not enjoy the same level of compile-time optimizations as templates.\n\n## Text Interpolation\n\nThe most basic form of data binding is text interpolation using the \"Mustache\" syntax (double curly braces):\n\n``` template\n<span>Message: {{ msg }}</span>\n```\n\nThe mustache tag will be replaced with the value of the `msg` property [from the corresponding component instance](reactivity-fundamentals#declaring-reactive-state). It will also be updated whenever the `msg` property changes.\n\n## Raw HTML\n\nThe double mustaches interpret the data as plain text, not HTML. In order to output real HTML, you will need to use the [`v-html` directive](../../api/built-in-directives#v-html):\n\n``` template\n<p>Using text interpolation: {{ rawHtml }}</p>\n<p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html=\"rawHtml\"></span></p>\n```\n\nHere we're encountering something new. The `v-html` attribute you're seeing is called a **directive**. Directives are prefixed with `v-` to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, we're basically saying \"keep this element's inner HTML up-to-date with the `rawHtml` property on the current active instance.\"\n\nThe contents of the `span` will be replaced with the value of the `rawHtml` property, interpreted as plain HTML - data bindings are ignored. Note that you cannot use `v-html` to compose template partials, because Vue is not a string-based templating engine. Instead, components are preferred as the fundamental unit for UI reuse and composition.\n\n**Security Warning**\n\nDynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to [XSS vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Only use `v-html` on trusted content and **never** on user-provided content.\n\n## Attribute Bindings\n\nMustaches cannot be used inside HTML attributes. Instead, use a [`v-bind` directive](../../api/built-in-directives#v-bind):\n\n``` template\n<div v-bind:id=\"dynamicId\"></div>\n```\n\nThe `v-bind` directive instructs Vue to keep the element's `id` attribute in sync with the component's `dynamicId` property. If the bound value is `null` or `undefined`, then the attribute will be removed from the rendered element.\n\n### Shorthand\n\nBecause `v-bind` is so commonly used, it has a dedicated shorthand syntax:\n\n``` template\n<div :id=\"dynamicId\"></div>\n```\n\nAttributes that start with `:` may look a bit different from normal HTML, but it is in fact a valid character for attribute names and all Vue-supported browsers can parse it correctly. In addition, they do not appear in the final rendered markup. The shorthand syntax is optional, but you will likely appreciate it when you learn more about its usage later.\n\n> For the rest of the guide, we will be using the shorthand syntax in code examples, as that's the most common usage for Vue developers.\n\n### Same-name Shorthand\n\nIf the attribute has the same name with the JavaScript value being bound, the syntax can be further shortened to omit the attribute value:\n\n``` template\n<!-- same as :id=\"id\" -->\n<div :id></div>\n\n<!-- this also works -->\n<div v-bind:id></div>\n```\n\nThis is similar to the property shorthand syntax when declaring objects in JavaScript. Note this is a feature that is only available in Vue 3.4 and above.\n\n### Boolean Attributes\n\n[Boolean attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes) are attributes that can indicate true / false values by their presence on an element. For example, [`disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) is one of the most commonly used boolean attributes.\n\n`v-bind` works a bit differently in this case:\n\n``` template\n<button :disabled=\"isButtonDisabled\">Button</button>\n```\n\nThe `disabled` attribute will be included if `isButtonDisabled` has a [truthy value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy). It will also be included if the value is an empty string, maintaining consistency with `<button disabled=\"\">`. For other [falsy values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) the attribute will be omitted.\n\n### Dynamically Binding Multiple Attributes\n\nIf you have a JavaScript object representing multiple attributes that looks like this:\n\n``` js\nconst objectOfAttrs = {\n  id: 'container',\n  class: 'wrapper'\n}\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    objectOfAttrs: {\n      id: 'container',\n      class: 'wrapper'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can bind them to a single element by using `v-bind` without an argument:\n\n``` template\n<div v-bind=\"objectOfAttrs\"></div>\n```\n\n## Using JavaScript Expressions\n\nSo far we've only been binding to simple property keys in our templates. But Vue actually supports the full power of JavaScript expressions inside all data bindings:\n\n``` template\n{{ number + 1 }}\n\n{{ ok ? 'YES' : 'NO' }}\n\n{{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}\n\n<div :id=\"`list-${id}`\"></div>\n```\n\nThese expressions will be evaluated as JavaScript in the data scope of the current component instance.\n\nIn Vue templates, JavaScript expressions can be used in the following positions:\n\n- Inside text interpolations (mustaches)\n- In the attribute value of any Vue directives (special attributes that start with `v-`)\n\n### Expressions Only\n\nEach binding can only contain **one single expression**. An expression is a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. A simple check is whether it can be used after `return`.\n\nTherefore, the following will **NOT** work:\n\n``` template\n<!-- this is a statement, not an expression: -->\n{{ var a = 1 }}\n\n<!-- flow control won't work either, use ternary expressions -->\n{{ if (ok) { return message } }}\n```\n\n### Calling Functions\n\nIt is possible to call a component-exposed method inside a binding expression:\n\n``` template\n<time :title=\"toTitleDate(date)\" :datetime=\"date\">\n  {{ formatDate(date) }}\n</time>\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nFunctions called inside binding expressions will be called every time the component updates, so they should **not** have any side effects, such as changing data or triggering asynchronous operations.\n\n### Restricted Globals Access\n\nTemplate expressions are sandboxed and only have access to a [restricted list of globals](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/shared/src/globalsAllowList.ts#L3). The list exposes commonly used built-in globals such as `Math` and `Date`.\n\nGlobals not explicitly included in the list, for example user-attached properties on `window`, will not be accessible in template expressions. You can, however, explicitly define additional globals for all Vue expressions by adding them to [`app.config.globalProperties`](../../api/application#app-config-globalproperties).\n\n## Directives\n\nDirectives are special attributes with the `v-` prefix. Vue provides a number of [built-in directives](../../api/built-in-directives), including `v-html` and `v-bind` which we have introduced above.\n\nDirective attribute values are expected to be single JavaScript expressions (with the exception of `v-for`, `v-on` and `v-slot`, which will be discussed in their respective sections later). A directive's job is to reactively apply updates to the DOM when the value of its expression changes. Take [`v-if`](../../api/built-in-directives#v-if) as an example:\n\n``` template\n<p v-if=\"seen\">Now you see me</p>\n```\n\nHere, the `v-if` directive would remove / insert the `<p>` element based on the truthiness of the value of the expression `seen`.\n\n### Arguments\n\nSome directives can take an \"argument\", denoted by a colon after the directive name. For example, the `v-bind` directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute:\n\n``` template\n<a v-bind:href=\"url\"> ... </a>\n\n<!-- shorthand -->\n<a :href=\"url\"> ... </a>\n```\n\nHere, `href` is the argument, which tells the `v-bind` directive to bind the element's `href` attribute to the value of the expression `url`. In the shorthand, everything before the argument (i.e., `v-bind:`) is condensed into a single character, `:`.\n\nAnother example is the `v-on` directive, which listens to DOM events:\n\n``` template\n<a v-on:click=\"doSomething\"> ... </a>\n\n<!-- shorthand -->\n<a @click=\"doSomething\"> ... </a>\n```\n\nHere, the argument is the event name to listen to: `click`. `v-on` has a corresponding shorthand, namely the `@` character. We will talk about event handling in more detail too.\n\n### Dynamic Arguments\n\nIt is also possible to use a JavaScript expression in a directive argument by wrapping it with square brackets:\n\n``` template\n<!--\nNote that there are some constraints to the argument expression,\nas explained in the \"Dynamic Argument Value Constraints\" and \"Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints\" sections below.\n-->\n<a v-bind:[attributeName]=\"url\"> ... </a>\n\n<!-- shorthand -->\n<a :[attributeName]=\"url\"> ... </a>\n```\n\nHere, `attributeName` will be dynamically evaluated as a JavaScript expression, and its evaluated value will be used as the final value for the argument. For example, if your component instance has a data property, `attributeName`, whose value is `\"href\"`, then this binding will be equivalent to `v-bind:href`.\n\nSimilarly, you can use dynamic arguments to bind a handler to a dynamic event name:\n\n``` template\n<a v-on:[eventName]=\"doSomething\"> ... </a>\n\n<!-- shorthand -->\n<a @[eventName]=\"doSomething\">\n```\n\nIn this example, when `eventName`'s value is `\"focus\"`, `v-on:[eventName]` will be equivalent to `v-on:focus`.\n\n#### Dynamic Argument Value Constraints\n\nDynamic arguments are expected to evaluate to a string, with the exception of `null`. The special value `null` can be used to explicitly remove the binding. Any other non-string value will trigger a warning.\n\n#### Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints\n\nDynamic argument expressions have some syntax constraints because certain characters, such as spaces and quotes, are invalid inside HTML attribute names. For example, the following is invalid:\n\n``` template\n<!-- This will trigger a compiler warning. -->\n<a :['foo' + bar]=\"value\"> ... </a>\n```\n\nIf you need to pass a complex dynamic argument, it's probably better to use a [computed property](computed), which we will cover shortly.\n\nWhen using in-DOM templates (templates directly written in an HTML file), you should also avoid naming keys with uppercase characters, as browsers will coerce attribute names into lowercase:\n\n``` template\n<a :[someAttr]=\"value\"> ... </a>\n```\n\nThe above will be converted to `:[someattr]` in in-DOM templates. If your component has a `someAttr` property instead of `someattr`, your code won't work. Templates inside Single-File Components are **not** subject to this constraint.\n\n### Modifiers\n\nModifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the `.prevent` modifier tells the `v-on` directive to call `event.preventDefault()` on the triggered event:\n\n``` template\n<form @submit.prevent=\"onSubmit\">...</form>\n```\n\nYou'll see other examples of modifiers later, [for `v-on`](event-handling#event-modifiers) and [for `v-model`](forms#modifiers), when we explore those features.\n\nAnd finally, here's the full directive syntax visualized:\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax)"

  summary: This page and many other chapters later in the guide contain different content for the Options API and the Composition API
  description: "# Reactivity Fundamentals\n\n**API Preference**\n\nThis page and many other chapters later in the guide contain different content for the Options API and the Composition API. Your current preference is Options APIComposition API. You can toggle between the API styles using the \"API Preference\" switches at the top of the left sidebar.\n\n## Declaring Reactive State\n\nWith the Options API, we use the `data` option to declare reactive state of a component. The option value should be a function that returns an object. Vue will call the function when creating a new component instance, and wrap the returned object in its reactivity system. Any top-level properties of this object are proxied on the component instance (`this` in methods and lifecycle hooks):\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 1\n    }\n  },\n\n  // `mounted` is a lifecycle hook which we will explain later\n  mounted() {\n    // `this` refers to the component instance.\n    console.log(this.count) // => 1\n\n    // data can be mutated as well\n    this.count = 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpFUNFqhDAQ/JXBpzsoHu2j3B2U/oYPpnGtoetGkrW2iP/eRFsPApthd2Zndilex7H8mqioimu0wY16r4W+Rx8ULXVmYsVSC9AaNafz/gcC6RTkHwHWT6IVnne85rI+1ZLr5YJmyG1qG7gIA3Yd2R/LhN77T8y9sz1mwuyYkXazcQI2SiHz/7iP3VlQexeb5KKjEKEe2lPyMIxeSBROohqxVO4E6yV6ppL9xykTy83tOQvd7tnzoZtDwhrBO2GYNFloYWLyxrzPPOi44WWLWUt618txvASUhhRCKSHgbZt2scKy7HfCujGOqWL9BVfOgyI=)\n\nThese instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the `data` function. Where necessary, use `null`, `undefined` or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.\n\nIt is possible to add a new property directly to `this` without including it in `data`. However, properties added this way will not be able to trigger reactive updates.\n\nVue uses a `$` prefix when exposing its own built-in APIs via the component instance. It also reserves the prefix `_` for internal properties. You should avoid using names for top-level `data` properties that start with either of these characters.\n\n### Reactive Proxy vs. Original\n\nIn Vue 3, data is made reactive by leveraging [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). Users coming from Vue 2 should be aware of the following edge case:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      someObject: {}\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    const newObject = {}\n    this.someObject = newObject\n\n    console.log(newObject === this.someObject) // false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you access `this.someObject` after assigning it, the value is a reactive proxy of the original `newObject`. **Unlike in Vue 2, the original `newObject` is left intact and will not be made reactive: make sure to always access reactive state as a property of `this`.**\n\n## Declaring Reactive State\n\n### `ref()`\n\nIn Composition API, the recommended way to declare reactive state is using the [`ref()`](../../api/reactivity-core#ref) function:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n```\n\n`ref()` takes the argument and returns it wrapped within a ref object with a `.value` property:\n\n``` js\nconst count = ref(0)\n\nconsole.log(count) // { value: 0 }\nconsole.log(count.value) // 0\n\ncount.value++\nconsole.log(count.value) // 1\n```\n\n> See also: [Typing Refs](../typescript/composition-api#typing-ref)\n\nTo access refs in a component's template, declare and return them from a component's `setup()` function:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  // `setup` is a special hook dedicated for the Composition API.\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n\n    // expose the ref to the template\n    return {\n      count\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div>{{ count }}</div>\n```\n\nNotice that we did **not** need to append `.value` when using the ref in the template. For convenience, refs are automatically unwrapped when used inside templates (with a few [caveats](#caveat-when-unwrapping-in-templates)).\n\nYou can also mutate a ref directly in event handlers:\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"count++\">\n  {{ count }}\n</button>\n```\n\nFor more complex logic, we can declare functions that mutate refs in the same scope and expose them as methods alongside the state:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n\n    function increment() {\n      // .value is needed in JavaScript\n      count.value++\n    }\n\n    // don't forget to expose the function as well.\n    return {\n      count,\n      increment\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExposed methods can then be used as event handlers:\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"increment\">\n  {{ count }}\n</button>\n```\n\nHere's the example live on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/vuejs-examples/pen/WNYbaqo), without using any build tools.\n\n### `<script setup>`\n\nManually exposing state and methods via `setup()` can be verbose. Luckily, it can be avoided when using [Single-File Components (SFCs)](../scaling-up/sfc). We can simplify the usage with `<script setup>`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">\n    {{ count }}\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jUEKgzAQRa8yZKMiaNcllvYe2dgwQqiZhDhxE3L3jrW4/DPvv1/UK8Zhz6juSm82uciwIef4MOR8DImhQMIFKiwpeGgEbQwZsoE2BhsyMUwH0d66475ksuwCgSOb0CNx20ExBCc77POase8NVUN6PBdlSwKjj+vMKAlAvzOzWJ52dfYzGXXpjPoBAKX856uopDGeFfnq8XKp+gWq4FAi)\n\nTop-level imports, variables and functions declared in `<script setup>` are automatically usable in the template of the same component. Think of the template as a JavaScript function declared in the same scope - it naturally has access to everything declared alongside it.\n\n**TIP**\n\nFor the rest of the guide, we will be primarily using SFC + `<script setup>` syntax for the Composition API code examples, as that is the most common usage for Vue developers.\n\nIf you are not using SFC, you can still use Composition API with the [`setup()`](../../api/composition-api-setup) option.\n\n### Why Refs?\n\nYou might be wondering why we need refs with the `.value` instead of plain variables. To explain that, we will need to briefly discuss how Vue's reactivity system works.\n\nWhen you use a ref in a template, and change the ref's value later, Vue automatically detects the change and updates the DOM accordingly. This is made possible with a dependency-tracking based reactivity system. When a component is rendered for the first time, Vue **tracks** every ref that was used during the render. Later on, when a ref is mutated, it will **trigger** a re-render for components that are tracking it.\n\nIn standard JavaScript, there is no way to detect the access or mutation of plain variables. However, we can intercept the get and set operations of an object's properties using getter and setter methods.\n\nThe `.value` property gives Vue the opportunity to detect when a ref has been accessed or mutated. Under the hood, Vue performs the tracking in its getter, and performs triggering in its setter. Conceptually, you can think of a ref as an object that looks like this:\n\n``` js\n// pseudo code, not actual implementation\nconst myRef = {\n  _value: 0,\n  get value() {\n    track()\n    return this._value\n  },\n  set value(newValue) {\n    this._value = newValue\n    trigger()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnother nice trait of refs is that unlike plain variables, you can pass refs into functions while retaining access to the latest value and the reactivity connection. This is particularly useful when refactoring complex logic into reusable code.\n\nThe reactivity system is discussed in more details in the [Reactivity in Depth](../extras/reactivity-in-depth) section.\n\n## Declaring Methods\n\nTo add methods to a component instance we use the `methods` option. This should be an object containing the desired methods:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    increment() {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    // methods can be called in lifecycle hooks, or other methods!\n    this.increment()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVue automatically binds the `this` value for `methods` so that it always refers to the component instance. This ensures that a method retains the correct `this` value if it's used as an event listener or callback. You should avoid using arrow functions when defining `methods`, as that prevents Vue from binding the appropriate `this` value:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    increment: () => {\n      // BAD: no `this` access here!\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJust like all other properties of the component instance, the `methods` are accessible from within the component's template. Inside a template they are most commonly used as event listeners:\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"increment\">{{ count }}</button>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNplj9EKwyAMRX8l+LSx0e65uLL9hy+dZlTWqtg4BuK/z1baDgZicsPJgUR2d656B2QN45P02lErDH6c9QQKn10YCKIwAKqj7nAsPYBHCt6sCUDaYKiBS8lpLuk8/yNSb9XUrKg20uOIhnYXAPV6qhbF6fRvmOeodn6hfzwLKkx+vN5OyIFwdENHmBMAfwQia+AmBy1fV8E2gWBtjOUASInXBcxLvN4MLH0BCe1i4Q==)\n\nIn the example above, the method `increment` will be called when the `<button>` is clicked.\n\n### Deep Reactivity\n\nIn Vue, state is deeply reactive by default. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      obj: {\n        nested: { count: 0 },\n        arr: ['foo', 'bar']\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    mutateDeeply() {\n      // these will work as expected.\n      this.obj.nested.count++\n      this.obj.arr.push('baz')\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRefs can hold any value type, including deeply nested objects, arrays, or JavaScript built-in data structures like `Map`.\n\nA ref will make its value deeply reactive. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst obj = ref({\n  nested: { count: 0 },\n  arr: ['foo', 'bar']\n})\n\nfunction mutateDeeply() {\n  // these will work as expected.\n  obj.value.nested.count++\n  obj.value.arr.push('baz')\n}\n```\n\nNon-primitive values are turned into reactive proxies via [`reactive()`](#reactive), which is discussed below.\n\nIt is also possible to opt-out of deep reactivity with [shallow refs](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref). For shallow refs, only `.value` access is tracked for reactivity. Shallow refs can be used for optimizing performance by avoiding the observation cost of large objects, or in cases where the inner state is managed by an external library.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n- [Reduce Reactivity Overhead for Large Immutable Structures](../best-practices/performance#reduce-reactivity-overhead-for-large-immutable-structures)\n- [Integration with External State Systems](../extras/reactivity-in-depth#integration-with-external-state-systems)\n\n### DOM Update Timing\n\nWhen you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the \"next tick\" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.\n\nTo wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the [nextTick()](../../api/general#nexttick) global API:\n\n``` js\nimport { nextTick } from 'vue'\n\nasync function increment() {\n  count.value++\n  await nextTick()\n  // Now the DOM is updated\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { nextTick } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    async increment() {\n      this.count++\n      await nextTick()\n      // Now the DOM is updated\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## `reactive()`\n\nThere is another way to declare reactive state, with the `reactive()` API. Unlike a ref which wraps the inner value in a special object, `reactive()` makes an object itself reactive:\n\n``` js\nimport { reactive } from 'vue'\n\nconst state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n```\n\n> See also: [Typing Reactive](../typescript/composition-api#typing-reactive)\n\nUsage in template:\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"state.count++\">\n  {{ state.count }}\n</button>\n```\n\nReactive objects are [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to intercept the access and mutation of all properties of a reactive object for reactivity tracking and triggering.\n\n`reactive()` converts the object deeply: nested objects are also wrapped with `reactive()` when accessed. It is also called by `ref()` internally when the ref value is an object. Similar to shallow refs, there is also the [`shallowReactive()`](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) API for opting-out of deep reactivity.\n\n### Reactive Proxy vs. Original\n\nIt is important to note that the returned value from `reactive()` is a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) of the original object, which is not equal to the original object:\n\n``` js\nconst raw = {}\nconst proxy = reactive(raw)\n\n// proxy is NOT equal to the original.\nconsole.log(proxy === raw) // false\n```\n\nOnly the proxy is reactive - mutating the original object will not trigger updates. Therefore, the best practice when working with Vue's reactivity system is to **exclusively use the proxied versions of your state**.\n\nTo ensure consistent access to the proxy, calling `reactive()` on the same object always returns the same proxy, and calling `reactive()` on an existing proxy also returns that same proxy:\n\n``` js\n// calling reactive() on the same object returns the same proxy\nconsole.log(reactive(raw) === proxy) // true\n\n// calling reactive() on a proxy returns itself\nconsole.log(reactive(proxy) === proxy) // true\n```\n\nThis rule applies to nested objects as well. Due to deep reactivity, nested objects inside a reactive object are also proxies:\n\n``` js\nconst proxy = reactive({})\n\nconst raw = {}\nproxy.nested = raw\n\nconsole.log(proxy.nested === raw) // false\n```\n\n### Limitations of `reactive()`\n\nThe `reactive()` API has a few limitations:\n\n1.  **Limited value types:** it only works for object types (objects, arrays, and [collection types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#keyed_collections) such as `Map` and `Set`). It cannot hold [primitive types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) such as `string`, `number` or `boolean`.\n\n2.  **Cannot replace entire object:** since Vue's reactivity tracking works over property access, we must always keep the same reference to the reactive object. This means we can't easily \"replace\" a reactive object because the reactivity connection to the first reference is lost:\n\n    ``` js\n    let state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n\n    // the above reference ({ count: 0 }) is no longer being tracked\n    // (reactivity connection is lost!)\n    state = reactive({ count: 1 })\n    ```\n\n3.  **Not destructure-friendly:** when we destructure a reactive object's primitive type property into local variables, or when we pass that property into a function, we will lose the reactivity connection:\n\n    ``` js\n    const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n\n    // count is disconnected from state.count when destructured.\n    let { count } = state\n    // does not affect original state\n    count++\n\n    // the function receives a plain number and\n    // won't be able to track changes to state.count\n    // we have to pass the entire object in to retain reactivity\n    callSomeFunction(state.count)\n    ```\n\nDue to these limitations, we recommend using `ref()` as the primary API for declaring reactive state.\n\n## Additional Ref Unwrapping Details\n\n### As Reactive Object Property\n\nA ref is automatically unwrapped when accessed or mutated as a property of a reactive object. In other words, it behaves like a normal property :\n\n``` js\nconst count = ref(0)\nconst state = reactive({\n  count\n})\n\nconsole.log(state.count) // 0\n\nstate.count = 1\nconsole.log(count.value) // 1\n```\n\nIf a new ref is assigned to a property linked to an existing ref, it will replace the old ref:\n\n``` js\nconst otherCount = ref(2)\n\nstate.count = otherCount\nconsole.log(state.count) // 2\n// original ref is now disconnected from state.count\nconsole.log(count.value) // 1\n```\n\nRef unwrapping only happens when nested inside a deep reactive object. It does not apply when it is accessed as a property of a [shallow reactive object](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive).\n\n### Caveat in Arrays and Collections\n\nUnlike reactive objects, there is **no** unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`:\n\n``` js\nconst books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])\n// need .value here\nconsole.log(books[0].value)\n\nconst map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))\n// need .value here\nconsole.log(map.get('count').value)\n```\n\n### Caveat when Unwrapping in Templates\n\nRef unwrapping in templates only applies if the ref is a top-level property in the template render context.\n\nIn the example below, `count` and `object` are top-level properties, but `object.id` is not:\n\n``` js\nconst count = ref(0)\nconst object = { id: ref(1) }\n```\n\nTherefore, this expression works as expected:\n\n``` template\n{{ count + 1 }}\n```\n\n...while this one does **NOT**:\n\n``` template\n{{ object.id + 1 }}\n```\n\nThe rendered result will be `[object Object]1` because `object.id` is not unwrapped when evaluating the expression and remains a ref object. To fix this, we can destructure `id` into a top-level property:\n\n``` js\nconst { id } = object\n```\n\n``` template\n{{ id + 1 }}\n```\n\nNow the render result will be `2`.\n\nAnother thing to note is that a ref does get unwrapped if it is the final evaluated value of a text interpolation (i.e. a `{{ }}` tag), so the following will render `1`:\n\n``` template\n{{ object.id }}\n```\n\nThis is just a convenience feature of text interpolation and is equivalent to `{{ object.id.value }}`.\n\n### Stateful Methods\n\nIn some cases, we may need to dynamically create a method function, for example creating a debounced event handler:\n\n``` js\nimport { debounce } from 'lodash-es'\n\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    // Debouncing with Lodash\n    click: debounce(function () {\n      // ... respond to click ...\n    }, 500)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this approach is problematic for components that are reused because a debounced function is **stateful**: it maintains some internal state on the elapsed time. If multiple component instances share the same debounced function, they will interfere with one another.\n\nTo keep each component instance's debounced function independent of the others, we can create the debounced version in the `created` lifecycle hook:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  created() {\n    // each instance now has its own copy of debounced handler\n    this.debouncedClick = _.debounce(this.click, 500)\n  },\n  unmounted() {\n    // also a good idea to cancel the timer\n    // when the component is removed\n    this.debouncedClick.cancel()\n  },\n  methods: {\n    click() {\n      // ... respond to click ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals)"

  summary: In-template expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations
  description: "# Computed Properties\n\n## Basic Example\n\nIn-template expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations. Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. For example, if we have an object with a nested array:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      author: {\n        name: 'John Doe',\n        books: [\n          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',\n          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',\n          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst author = reactive({\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  books: [\n    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',\n    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',\n    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nAnd we want to display different messages depending on if `author` already has some books or not:\n\n``` template\n<p>Has published books:</p>\n<span>{{ author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}</span>\n```\n\nAt this point, the template is getting a bit cluttered. We have to look at it for a second before realizing that it performs a calculation depending on `author.books`. More importantly, we probably don't want to repeat ourselves if we need to include this calculation in the template more than once.\n\nThat's why for complex logic that includes reactive data, it is recommended to use a **computed property**. Here's the same example, refactored:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      author: {\n        name: 'John Doe',\n        books: [\n          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',\n          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',\n          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    // a computed getter\n    publishedBooksMessage() {\n      // `this` points to the component instance\n      return this.author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<p>Has published books:</p>\n<span>{{ publishedBooksMessage }}</span>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFkN1KxDAQhV/l0JsqaFfUq1IquwiKsF6JINaLbDNui20S8rO4lL676c82eCFCIDOZMzkzXxetlUoOjqI0ykypa2XzQtC3ktqC0ydzjUVXCIAzy87OpxjQZJ0WpwxgzlZSp+EBEKylFPGTrATuJcUXobST8sukeA8vQPzqCNe4xJofmCiJ48HV/FfbLLrxog0zdfmn4tYrXirC9mgs6WMcBB+nsJ+C8erHH0rZKmeJL0sot2tqUxHfDONuyRi2p4BggWCr2iQTgGTcLGlI7G2FHFe4Q/xGJoYn8SznQSbTQviTrRboPrHUqoZZ8hmQqfyRmTDFTC1bqalsFBN5183o/3NG33uvoWUwXYyi/gdTEpwK)\n\nHere we have declared a computed property `publishedBooksMessage`.\n\nTry to change the value of the `books` array in the application `data` and you will see how `publishedBooksMessage` is changing accordingly.\n\nYou can data-bind to computed properties in templates just like a normal property. Vue is aware that `this.publishedBooksMessage` depends on `this.author.books`, so it will update any bindings that depend on `this.publishedBooksMessage` when `this.author.books` changes.\n\nSee also: [Typing Computed Properties](../typescript/options-api#typing-computed-properties)\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { reactive, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst author = reactive({\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  books: [\n    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',\n    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',\n    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'\n  ]\n})\n\n// a computed ref\nconst publishedBooksMessage = computed(() => {\n  return author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <p>Has published books:</p>\n  <span>{{ publishedBooksMessage }}</span>\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp1kE9Lw0AQxb/KI5dtoTainkoaaREUoZ5EEONhm0ybYLO77J9CCfnuzta0vdjbzr6Zeb95XbIwZroPlMySzJW2MR6OfDB5oZrWaOvRwZIsfbOnCUrdmuCpQo+N1S0ET4pCFarUynnI4GttMT9PjLpCAUq2NIN41bXCkyYxiZ9rrX/cDF/xDYiPQLjDDRbVXqqSHZ5DUw2tg3zP8lK6pvxHe2DtvSasDs6TPTAT8F2ofhzh0hTygm5pc+I1Yb1rXE3VMsKsyDm5JcY/9Y5GY8xzHI+wnIpVw4nTI/10R2rra+S4xSPEJzkBvvNNs310ztK/RDlLLjy1Zic9cQVkJn+R7gIwxJGlMXiWnZEq77orhH3Pq2NH9DjvTfpfSBSbmA==)\n\nHere we have declared a computed property `publishedBooksMessage`. The `computed()` function expects to be passed a getter function, and the returned value is a **computed ref**. Similar to normal refs, you can access the computed result as `publishedBooksMessage.value`. Computed refs are also auto-unwrapped in templates so you can reference them without `.value` in template expressions.\n\nA computed property automatically tracks its reactive dependencies. Vue is aware that the computation of `publishedBooksMessage` depends on `author.books`, so it will update any bindings that depend on `publishedBooksMessage` when `author.books` changes.\n\nSee also: [Typing Computed](../typescript/composition-api#typing-computed)\n\n## Computed Caching vs. Methods\n\nYou may have noticed we can achieve the same result by invoking a method in the expression:\n\n``` template\n<p>{{ calculateBooksMessage() }}</p>\n```\n\n``` js\n// in component\nmethods: {\n  calculateBooksMessage() {\n    return this.author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// in component\nfunction calculateBooksMessage() {\n  return author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'\n}\n```\n\nInstead of a computed property, we can define the same function as a method. For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. However, the difference is that **computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies.** A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. This means as long as `author.books` has not changed, multiple access to `publishedBooksMessage` will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the getter function again.\n\nThis also means the following computed property will never update, because `Date.now()` is not a reactive dependency:\n\n``` js\ncomputed: {\n  now() {\n    return Date.now()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst now = computed(() => Date.now())\n```\n\nIn comparison, a method invocation will **always** run the function whenever a re-render happens.\n\nWhy do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property `list`, which requires looping through a huge array and doing a lot of computations. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on `list`. Without caching, we would be executing `list`’s getter many more times than necessary! In cases where you do not want caching, use a method call instead.\n\n## Writable Computed\n\nComputed properties are by default getter-only. If you attempt to assign a new value to a computed property, you will receive a runtime warning. In the rare cases where you need a \"writable\" computed property, you can create one by providing both a getter and a setter:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      firstName: 'John',\n      lastName: 'Doe'\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    fullName: {\n      // getter\n      get() {\n        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName\n      },\n      // setter\n      set(newValue) {\n        // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.\n        [this.firstName, this.lastName] = newValue.split(' ')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow when you run `this.fullName = 'John Doe'`, the setter will be invoked and `this.firstName` and `this.lastName` will be updated accordingly.\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst firstName = ref('John')\nconst lastName = ref('Doe')\n\nconst fullName = computed({\n  // getter\n  get() {\n    return firstName.value + ' ' + lastName.value\n  },\n  // setter\n  set(newValue) {\n    // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.\n    [firstName.value, lastName.value] = newValue.split(' ')\n  }\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nNow when you run `fullName.value = 'John Doe'`, the setter will be invoked and `firstName` and `lastName` will be updated accordingly.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Getters should be side-effect free\n\nIt is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects. For example, **don't mutate other state, make async requests, or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter!** Think of a computed property as declaratively describing how to derive a value based on other values - its only responsibility should be computing and returning that value. Later in the guide we will discuss how we can perform side effects in reaction to state changes with [watchers](watchers).\n\n### Avoid mutating computed value\n\nThe returned value from a computed property is derived state. Think of it as a temporary snapshot - every time the source state changes, a new snapshot is created. It does not make sense to mutate a snapshot, so a computed return value should be treated as read-only and never be mutated - instead, update the source state it depends on to trigger new computations.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed)"
- name: 7. Class and Style Bindings  (Essentials)
  id: guide/essentials/class-and-style
  summary: A common need for data binding is manipulating an element's class list and inline styles
  description: "# Class and Style Bindings\n\nA common need for data binding is manipulating an element's class list and inline styles. Since `class` and `style` are both attributes, we can use `v-bind` to assign them a string value dynamically, much like with other attributes. However, trying to generate those values using string concatenation can be annoying and error-prone. For this reason, Vue provides special enhancements when `v-bind` is used with `class` and `style`. In addition to strings, the expressions can also evaluate to objects or arrays.\n\n## Binding HTML Classes\n\n### Binding to Objects\n\nWe can pass an object to `:class` (short for `v-bind:class`) to dynamically toggle classes:\n\n``` template\n<div :class=\"{ active: isActive }\"></div>\n```\n\nThe above syntax means the presence of the `active` class will be determined by the [truthiness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) of the data property `isActive`.\n\nYou can have multiple classes toggled by having more fields in the object. In addition, the `:class` directive can also co-exist with the plain `class` attribute. So given the following state:\n\n``` js\nconst isActive = ref(true)\nconst hasError = ref(false)\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    isActive: true,\n    hasError: false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the following template:\n\n``` template\n<div\n  class=\"static\"\n  :class=\"{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }\"\n></div>\n```\n\nIt will render:\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"static active\"></div>\n```\n\nWhen `isActive` or `hasError` changes, the class list will be updated accordingly. For example, if `hasError` becomes `true`, the class list will become `\"static active text-danger\"`.\n\nThe bound object doesn't have to be inline:\n\n``` js\nconst classObject = reactive({\n  active: true,\n  'text-danger': false\n})\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    classObject: {\n      active: true,\n      'text-danger': false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div :class=\"classObject\"></div>\n```\n\nThis will render:\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"active\"></div>\n```\n\nWe can also bind to a [computed property](computed) that returns an object. This is a common and powerful pattern:\n\n``` js\nconst isActive = ref(true)\nconst error = ref(null)\n\nconst classObject = computed(() => ({\n  active: isActive.value && !error.value,\n  'text-danger': error.value && error.value.type === 'fatal'\n}))\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    isActive: true,\n    error: null\n  }\n},\ncomputed: {\n  classObject() {\n    return {\n      active: this.isActive && !this.error,\n      'text-danger': this.error && this.error.type === 'fatal'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div :class=\"classObject\"></div>\n```\n\n### Binding to Arrays\n\nWe can bind `:class` to an array to apply a list of classes:\n\n``` js\nconst activeClass = ref('active')\nconst errorClass = ref('text-danger')\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    activeClass: 'active',\n    errorClass: 'text-danger'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div :class=\"[activeClass, errorClass]\"></div>\n```\n\nWhich will render:\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"active text-danger\"></div>\n```\n\nIf you would like to also toggle a class in the list conditionally, you can do it with a ternary expression:\n\n``` template\n<div :class=\"[isActive ? activeClass : '', errorClass]\"></div>\n```\n\nThis will always apply `errorClass`, but `activeClass` will only be applied when `isActive` is truthy.\n\nHowever, this can be a bit verbose if you have multiple conditional classes. That's why it's also possible to use the object syntax inside the array syntax:\n\n``` template\n<div :class=\"[{ active: isActive }, errorClass]\"></div>\n```\n\n### With Components\n\n> This section assumes knowledge of [Components](component-basics). Feel free to skip it and come back later.\n\nWhen you use the `class` attribute on a component with a single root element, those classes will be added to the component's root element and merged with any existing class already on it.\n\nFor example, if we have a component named `MyComponent` with the following template:\n\n``` template\n<!-- child component template -->\n<p class=\"foo bar\">Hi!</p>\n```\n\nThen add some classes when using it:\n\n``` template\n<!-- when using the component -->\n<MyComponent class=\"baz boo\" />\n```\n\nThe rendered HTML will be:\n\n``` template\n<p class=\"foo bar baz boo\">Hi!</p>\n```\n\nThe same is true for class bindings:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent :class=\"{ active: isActive }\" />\n```\n\nWhen `isActive` is truthy, the rendered HTML will be:\n\n``` template\n<p class=\"foo bar active\">Hi!</p>\n```\n\nIf your component has multiple root elements, you would need to define which element will receive this class. You can do this using the `$attrs` component property:\n\n``` template\n<!-- MyComponent template using $attrs -->\n<p :class=\"$attrs.class\">Hi!</p>\n<span>This is a child component</span>\n```\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent class=\"baz\" />\n```\n\nWill render:\n\n``` html\n<p class=\"baz\">Hi!</p>\n<span>This is a child component</span>\n```\n\nYou can learn more about component attribute inheritance in [Fallthrough Attributes](../components/attrs) section.\n\n## Binding Inline Styles\n\n### Binding to Objects\n\n`:style` supports binding to JavaScript object values - it corresponds to an [HTML element's `style` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style):\n\n``` js\nconst activeColor = ref('red')\nconst fontSize = ref(30)\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    activeColor: 'red',\n    fontSize: 30\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div :style=\"{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }\"></div>\n```\n\nAlthough camelCase keys are recommended, `:style` also supports kebab-cased CSS property keys (corresponds to how they are used in actual CSS) - for example:\n\n``` template\n<div :style=\"{ 'font-size': fontSize + 'px' }\"></div>\n```\n\nIt is often a good idea to bind to a style object directly so that the template is cleaner:\n\n``` js\nconst styleObject = reactive({\n  color: 'red',\n  fontSize: '13px'\n})\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    styleObject: {\n      color: 'red',\n      fontSize: '13px'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div :style=\"styleObject\"></div>\n```\n\nAgain, object style binding is often used in conjunction with computed properties that return objects.\n\n### Binding to Arrays\n\nWe can bind `:style` to an array of multiple style objects. These objects will be merged and applied to the same element:\n\n``` template\n<div :style=\"[baseStyles, overridingStyles]\"></div>\n```\n\n### Auto-prefixing\n\nWhen you use a CSS property that requires a [vendor prefix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix) in `:style`, Vue will automatically add the appropriate prefix. Vue does this by checking at runtime to see which style properties are supported in the current browser. If the browser doesn't support a particular property then various prefixed variants will be tested to try to find one that is supported.\n\n### Multiple Values\n\nYou can provide an array of multiple (prefixed) values to a style property, for example:\n\n``` template\n<div :style=\"{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }\"></div>\n```\n\nThis will only render the last value in the array which the browser supports. In this example, it will render `display: flex` for browsers that support the unprefixed version of flexbox.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/class-and-style](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/class-and-style)"

But what if we want to toggle more than one element? In this case we can use `v-if` on a `<template>` element, which serves as an invisible wrapper. The final rendered result will not include the `<template>` element.\n\n``` template\n<template v-if=\"ok\">\n  <h1>Title</h1>\n  <p>Paragraph 1</p>\n  <p>Paragraph 2</p>\n</template>\n```\n\n`v-else` and `v-else-if` can also be used on `<template>`.\n\n## `v-show`\n\nAnother option for conditionally displaying an element is the `v-show` directive. The usage is largely the same:\n\n``` template\n<h1 v-show=\"ok\">Hello!</h1>\n```\n\nThe difference is that an element with `v-show` will always be rendered and remain in the DOM; `v-show` only toggles the `display` CSS property of the element.\n\n`v-show` doesn't support the `<template>` element, nor does it work with `v-else`.\n\n## `v-if` vs. `v-show`\n\n`v-if` is \"real\" conditional rendering because it ensures that event listeners and child components inside the conditional block are properly destroyed and re-created during toggles.\n\n`v-if` is also **lazy**: if the condition is false on initial render, it will not do anything - the conditional block won't be rendered until the condition becomes true for the first time.\n\nIn comparison, `v-show` is much simpler - the element is always rendered regardless of initial condition, with CSS-based toggling.\n\nGenerally speaking, `v-if` has higher toggle costs while `v-show` has higher initial render costs. So prefer `v-show` if you need to toggle something very often, and prefer `v-if` if the condition is unlikely to change at runtime.\n\n## `v-if` with `v-for`\n\n**Note**\n\nIt's **not** recommended to use `v-if` and `v-for` on the same element due to implicit precedence. Refer to [style guide](../../style-guide/rules-essential#avoid-v-if-with-v-for) for details.\n\nWhen `v-if` and `v-for` are both used on the same element, `v-if` will be evaluated first. See the [list rendering guide](list#v-for-with-v-if) for details.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional)"

  summary: We can use the v-for directive to render a list of items based on an array
  description: "# List Rendering\n\n## `v-for`\n\nWe can use the `v-for` directive to render a list of items based on an array. The `v-for` directive requires a special syntax in the form of `item in items`, where `items` is the source data array and `item` is an **alias** for the array element being iterated on:\n\n``` js\nconst items = ref([{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }])\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    items: [{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<li v-for=\"item in items\">\n  {{ item.message }}\n</li>\n```\n\nInside the `v-for` scope, template expressions have access to all parent scope properties. In addition, `v-for` also supports an optional second alias for the index of the current item:\n\n``` js\nconst parentMessage = ref('Parent')\nconst items = ref([{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }])\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    parentMessage: 'Parent',\n    items: [{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<li v-for=\"(item, index) in items\">\n  {{ parentMessage }} - {{ index }} - {{ item.message }}\n</li>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpdTsuqwjAQ/ZVDNlFQu5d64bpwJ7g3LopOJdAmIRlFCPl3p60PcDWcM+eV1X8Iq/uN1FrV6RxtYCTiW/gzzvbBR0ZGpBYFbfQ9tEi1ccadvUuM0ERyvKeUmithMyhn+jCSev4WWaY+vZ7HjH5Sr6F33muUhTR8uW0ThTuJua6mPbJEgGSErmEaENedxX3Z+rgxajbEL2DdhR5zOVOdUSIEDOf8M7IULCHsaPgiMa1eK4QcS6rOSkhdfapVeQLQEWnH)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpVTssKwjAQ/JUllyr0cS9V0IM3wbvxEOxWAm0a0m0phPy7m1aqhpDsDLMz48XJ2nwaUZSiGp5OWzpKg7PtHUGNjRpbAi8NQK1I7fbrLMkhjc5EJAn4WOXQ0BWHQb2whOS24CSN6qjXhN1Qwt1Dt2kufZ9ASOGXOyvH3GMNCdGdH75VsZVjwGa2VYQRUdVqmLKmdwcpdjEnBW1qnPf8wZIrBQujoff/RSEEyIDZZeGLeCn/dGJyCSlazSZVsUWL8AYme21i)\n\nThe variable scoping of `v-for` is similar to the following JavaScript:\n\n``` js\nconst parentMessage = 'Parent'\nconst items = [\n  /* ... */\n]\n\nitems.forEach((item, index) => {\n  // has access to outer scope `parentMessage`\n  // but `item` and `index` are only available in here\n  console.log(parentMessage, item.message, index)\n})\n```\n\nNotice how the `v-for` value matches the function signature of the `forEach` callback. In fact, you can use destructuring on the `v-for` item alias similar to destructuring function arguments:\n\n``` template\n<li v-for=\"{ message } in items\">\n  {{ message }}\n</li>\n\n<!-- with index alias -->\n<li v-for=\"({ message }, index) in items\">\n  {{ message }} {{ index }}\n</li>\n```\n\nFor nested `v-for`, scoping also works similar to nested functions. Each `v-for` scope has access to parent scopes:\n\n``` template\n<li v-for=\"item in items\">\n  <span v-for=\"childItem in item.children\">\n    {{ item.message }} {{ childItem }}\n  </span>\n</li>\n```\n\nYou can also use `of` as the delimiter instead of `in`, so that it is closer to JavaScript's syntax for iterators:\n\n``` template\n<div v-for=\"item of items\"></div>\n```\n\n## `v-for` with an Object\n\nYou can also use `v-for` to iterate through the properties of an object. The iteration order will be based on the result of calling `Object.keys()` on the object:\n\n``` js\nconst myObject = reactive({\n  title: 'How to do lists in Vue',\n  author: 'Jane Doe',\n  publishedAt: '2016-04-10'\n})\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    myObject: {\n      title: 'How to do lists in Vue',\n      author: 'Jane Doe',\n      publishedAt: '2016-04-10'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li v-for=\"value in myObject\">\n    {{ value }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nYou can also provide a second alias for the property's name (a.k.a. key):\n\n``` template\n<li v-for=\"(value, key) in myObject\">\n  {{ key }}: {{ value }}\n</li>\n```\n\nAnd another for the index:\n\n``` template\n<li v-for=\"(value, key, index) in myObject\">\n  {{ index }}. {{ key }}: {{ value }}\n</li>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jjFvgzAQhf/KE0sSCQKpqg7IqRSpQ9WlWycvBC6KW2NbcKaNEP+9B7Tx4nt33917Y3IKYT9ESspE9XVnAqMnjuFZO9MG3zFGdFTVbAbChEvnW2yE32inXe1dz2hv7+dPqhnHO7kdtQPYsKUSm1f/DfZoPKzpuYdx+JAL6cxUka++E+itcoQX/9cO8SzslZoTy+yhODxlxWN2KMR22mmn8jWrpBTB1AZbMc2KVbTyQ56yBkN28d1RJ9uhspFSfNEtFf+GfnZzjP/oOll2NQPjuM4xTftZyIaU5VwuN0SsqMqtWZxUvliq/J4jmX4BTCp08A==)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9T8FqwzAM/RWRS1pImnSMHYI3KOwwdtltJ1/cRqXe3Ng4ctYS8u+TbVJjLD3rPelpLg7O7aaARVeI8eS1ozc54M1ZT9DjWQVDMMsBoFekNtucS/JIwQ8RSQI+1/vX8QdP1K2E+EmaDHZQftg/IAu9BaNHGkEP8B2wrFYxgAp0sZ6pn2pAeLepmEuSXDiy7oL9gduXT+3+pW6f631bZoqkJY/kkB6+onnswoDw6owijIhEMByjUBgNU322/lUWm0mZgBX84r1ifz3ettHmupYskjbanedch2XZRcAKTnnvGVIPBpkqGqPTJNGkkaJ5+CiWf4KkfBs=)\n\n## `v-for` with a Range\n\n`v-for` can also take an integer. In this case it will repeat the template that many times, based on a range of `1...n`.\n\n``` template\n<span v-for=\"n in 10\">{{ n }}</span>\n```\n\nNote here `n` starts with an initial value of `1` instead of `0`.\n\n## `v-for` on `<template>`\n\nSimilar to template `v-if`, you can also use a `<template>` tag with `v-for` to render a block of multiple elements. For example:\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <template v-for=\"item in items\">\n    <li>{{ item.msg }}</li>\n    <li class=\"divider\" role=\"presentation\"></li>\n  </template>\n</ul>\n```\n\n## `v-for` with `v-if`\n\n**Note**\n\nIt's **not** recommended to use `v-if` and `v-for` on the same element due to implicit precedence. Refer to [style guide](../../style-guide/rules-essential#avoid-v-if-with-v-for) for details.\n\nWhen they exist on the same node, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`. That means the `v-if` condition will not have access to variables from the scope of the `v-for`:\n\n``` template\n<!--\nThis will throw an error because property \"todo\"\nis not defined on instance.\n-->\n<li v-for=\"todo in todos\" v-if=\"!todo.isComplete\">\n  {{ todo.name }}\n</li>\n```\n\nThis can be fixed by moving `v-for` to a wrapping `<template>` tag (which is also more explicit):\n\n``` template\n<template v-for=\"todo in todos\">\n  <li v-if=\"!todo.isComplete\">\n    {{ todo.name }}\n  </li>\n</template>\n```\n\n## Maintaining State with `key`\n\nWhen Vue is updating a list of elements rendered with `v-for`, by default it uses an \"in-place patch\" strategy. If the order of the data items has changed, instead of moving the DOM elements to match the order of the items, Vue will patch each element in-place and make sure it reflects what should be rendered at that particular index.\n\nThis default mode is efficient, but **only suitable when your list render output does not rely on child component state or temporary DOM state (e.g. form input values)**.\n\nTo give Vue a hint so that it can track each node's identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements, you need to provide a unique `key` attribute for each item:\n\n``` template\n<div v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\">\n  <!-- content -->\n</div>\n```\n\nWhen using `<template v-for>`, the `key` should be placed on the `<template>` container:\n\n``` template\n<template v-for=\"todo in todos\" :key=\"todo.name\">\n  <li>{{ todo.name }}</li>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Note**\n\n`key` here is a special attribute being bound with `v-bind`. It should not be confused with the property key variable when [using `v-for` with an object](#v-for-with-an-object).\n\n[It is recommended](../../style-guide/rules-essential#use-keyed-v-for) to provide a `key` attribute with `v-for` whenever possible, unless the iterated DOM content is simple (i.e. contains no components or stateful DOM elements), or you are intentionally relying on the default behavior for performance gains.\n\nThe `key` binding expects primitive values - i.e. strings and numbers. Do not use objects as `v-for` keys. For detailed usage of the `key` attribute, please see the [`key` API documentation](../../api/built-in-special-attributes#key).\n\n## `v-for` with a Component\n\n> This section assumes knowledge of [Components](component-basics). Feel free to skip it and come back later.\n\nYou can directly use `v-for` on a component, like any normal element (don't forget to provide a `key`):\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\" />\n```\n\nHowever, this won't automatically pass any data to the component, because components have isolated scopes of their own. In order to pass the iterated data into the component, we should also use props:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent\n  v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n  :item=\"item\"\n  :index=\"index\"\n  :key=\"item.id\"\n/>\n```\n\nThe reason for not automatically injecting `item` into the component is because that makes the component tightly coupled to how `v-for` works. Being explicit about where its data comes from makes the component reusable in other situations.\n\nCheck out [this example of a simple todo list](https://play.vuejs.org/#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) to see how to render a list of components using `v-for`, passing different data to each instance.\n\nCheck out [this example of a simple todo list](https://play.vuejs.org/#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) to see how to render a list of components using `v-for`, passing different data to each instance.\n\n## Array Change Detection\n\n### Mutation Methods\n\nVue is able to detect when a reactive array's mutation methods are called and trigger necessary updates. These mutation methods are:\n\n- `push()`\n- `pop()`\n- `shift()`\n- `unshift()`\n- `splice()`\n- `sort()`\n- `reverse()`\n\n### Replacing an Array\n\nMutation methods, as the name suggests, mutate the original array they are called on. In comparison, there are also non-mutating methods, e.g. `filter()`, `concat()` and `slice()`, which do not mutate the original array but **always return a new array**. When working with non-mutating methods, we should replace the old array with the new one:\n\n``` js\n// `items` is a ref with array value\nitems.value = items.value.filter((item) => item.message.match(/Foo/))\n```\n\n``` js\nthis.items = this.items.filter((item) => item.message.match(/Foo/))\n```\n\nYou might think this will cause Vue to throw away the existing DOM and re-render the entire list - luckily, that is not the case. Vue implements some smart heuristics to maximize DOM element reuse, so replacing an array with another array containing overlapping objects is a very efficient operation.\n\n## Displaying Filtered/Sorted Results\n\nSometimes we want to display a filtered or sorted version of an array without actually mutating or resetting the original data. In this case, you can create a computed property that returns the filtered or sorted array.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\nconst numbers = ref([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\nconst evenNumbers = computed(() => {\n  return numbers.value.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0)\n})\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n  }\n},\ncomputed: {\n  evenNumbers() {\n    return this.numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<li v-for=\"n in evenNumbers\">{{ n }}</li>\n```\n\nIn situations where computed properties are not feasible (e.g. inside nested `v-for` loops), you can use a method:\n\n``` js\nconst sets = ref([\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n])\n\nfunction even(numbers) {\n  return numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0)\n}\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    sets: [[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]\n  }\n},\nmethods: {\n  even(numbers) {\n    return numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<ul v-for=\"numbers in sets\">\n  <li v-for=\"n in even(numbers)\">{{ n }}</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nBe careful with `reverse()` and `sort()` in a computed property! These two methods will mutate the original array, which should be avoided in computed getters. Create a copy of the original array before calling these methods:\n\n``` diff\n- return numbers.reverse()\n+ return [...numbers].reverse()\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list)"

  id: guide/essentials/event-handling
  summary: We can use the v-on directive, which we typically shorten to the @ symbol, to listen to DOM events and run some JavaScript when they're triggered
  description: "# Event Handling\n\n## Listening to Events\n\nWe can use the `v-on` directive, which we typically shorten to the `@` symbol, to listen to DOM events and run some JavaScript when they're triggered. The usage would be `v-on:click=\"handler\"` or with the shortcut, `@click=\"handler\"`.\n\nThe handler value can be one of the following:\n\n1.  **Inline handlers:** Inline JavaScript to be executed when the event is triggered (similar to the native `onclick` attribute).\n\n2.  **Method handlers:** A property name or path that points to a method defined on the component.\n\n## Inline Handlers\n\nInline handlers are typically used in simple cases, for example:\n\n``` js\nconst count = ref(0)\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    count: 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"count++\">Add 1</button>\n<p>Count is: {{ count }}</p>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jssKgzAURH/lko0tgrbbEqX+Q5fZaLxiqHmQ3LgJ+fdqFZcD58xMYp1z1RqRvRgP0itHEJCia4VR2llPkMDjBBkmbzUUG1oII4y0JhBIGw2hh2Znbo+7MLw+WjZ/C4TaLT3hnogPkcgaeMtFyW8j2GmXpWBtN47w5PWBHLhrPzPCKfWDXRHmPsCAaOBfgSOkdH3IGUhpDBWv9/e8vsZZ/gFFhFJN)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jcEKgzAQRH9lyKlF0PYqqdR/6DGXaLYo1RjiRgrivzepIizLzu7sm1XUzuVLIFEKObe+d1wpS183eYahtw4DY1UWMJr15ZpmxYAnDt7uF0BxOwXL5Evc0kbxlmyxxZLFyY2CaXSDZkqKZROYJ4tnO/Tt56HEgckyJaraGNxlsVt2u6teHeF40s20EDo9oyGy+CPIYF1xULBt4H6kOZeFiwBZnOFi+wH0B1hk)\n\n## Method Handlers\n\nThe logic for many event handlers will be more complex though, and likely isn't feasible with inline handlers. That's why `v-on` can also accept the name or path of a component method you'd like to call.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\nconst name = ref('Vue.js')\n\nfunction greet(event) {\n  alert(`Hello ${name.value}!`)\n  // `event` is the native DOM event\n  if (event) {\n    alert(event.target.tagName)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    name: 'Vue.js'\n  }\n},\nmethods: {\n  greet(event) {\n    // `this` inside methods points to the current active instance\n    alert(`Hello ${this.name}!`)\n    // `event` is the native DOM event\n    if (event) {\n      alert(event.target.tagName)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- `greet` is the name of the method defined above -->\n<button @click=\"greet\">Greet</button>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpVj0FLxDAQhf/KMwjtXtq7dBcFQS/qzVMOrWFao2kSkkkvpf/dJIuCEBgm771vZnbx4H23JRJ3YogqaM+IxMlfpNWrd4GxI9CMA3NwK5psbaSVVjkbGXZaCediaJv3RN1XbE5FnZNVrJ3FEoi4pY0sn7BLC0yGArfjMxnjcLsXQrdNJtFxM+Ys0PcYa2CEjuBPylNYb4THtxdUobj0jH/YX3D963gKC5WyvGZ+xR7S5jf01yPzeblhWr2ZmErHw0dizivfK6PV91mKursUl6dSh/4qZ+vQ/+XE8QODonDi)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNplUE1LxDAQ/StjEbYL0t5LXRQEvag3Tz00prNtNE1CMilC6X83SUkRhJDJfLz3Jm8tHo2pFo9FU7SOW2Ho0in8MdoSDHhlXhKsnQIYGLHyvL8BLJK3KmcAis3YwOnDY/XlTnt1i2G7i/eMNOnBNRkwWkQqcUFFByVAXUNPk3A9COXEgBkGRgtFDkgDTQjcWxuAwDiJBeMsMcUxszCJlsr+BaXUcLtGwiqut930579KST1IBd5Aqlgie3p/hdTIk+IK//bMGqleEbMjxjC+BZVDIv0+m9CpcNr6MDgkhLORjDBm1H56Iq3ggUvBv++7IhnUFZfnGNt6b4fRtj5wxfYL9p+Sjw==)\n\nA method handler automatically receives the native DOM Event object that triggers it - in the example above, we are able to access the element dispatching the event via `event.target.tagName`.\n\nSee also: [Typing Event Handlers](../typescript/composition-api#typing-event-handlers)\n\nSee also: [Typing Event Handlers](../typescript/options-api#typing-event-handlers)\n\n### Method vs. Inline Detection\n\nThe template compiler detects method handlers by checking whether the `v-on` value string is a valid JavaScript identifier or property access path. For example, `foo`, `foo.bar` and `foo['bar']` are treated as method handlers, while `foo()` and `count++` are treated as inline handlers.\n\n## Calling Methods in Inline Handlers\n\nInstead of binding directly to a method name, we can also call methods in an inline handler. This allows us to pass the method custom arguments instead of the native event:\n\n``` js\nfunction say(message) {\n  alert(message)\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nmethods: {\n  say(message) {\n    alert(message)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"say('hello')\">Say hello</button>\n<button @click=\"say('bye')\">Say bye</button>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9jTEOwjAMRa8SeSld6I5CBWdg9ZJGBiJSN2ocpKjq3UmpFDGx+Vn//b/ANYTjOxGcQEc7uyAqkqTQI98TW3ETq2jyYaQYzYNatSArZTzNUn/IK7Ludr2IBYTG4I3QRqKHJFJ6LtY7+zojbIXNk7yfmhahv5msvqS7PfnHGjJVp9w/hu7qKKwfEd1NSg==)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNptjUEKwjAQRa8yZFO7sfsSi57B7WzGdjTBtA3NVC2ldzehEFwIw8D7vM9f1cX742tmVSsd2sl6aXDgjx8ngY7vNDuBFQeAnsWMXagToQAEWg49h0APLncDAIUcT5LzlKJsqRBfPF3ljQjCvXcknEj0bRYZBzi3zrbPE6o0UBhblKiaKy1grK52J/oA//23IcmNBD8dXeVBtX0BF0pXsg==)\n\n## Accessing Event Argument in Inline Handlers\n\nSometimes we also need to access the original DOM event in an inline handler. You can pass it into a method using the special `$event` variable, or use an inline arrow function:\n\n``` template\n<!-- using $event special variable -->\n<button @click=\"warn('Form cannot be submitted yet.', $event)\">\n  Submit\n</button>\n\n<!-- using inline arrow function -->\n<button @click=\"(event) => warn('Form cannot be submitted yet.', event)\">\n  Submit\n</button>\n```\n\n``` js\nfunction warn(message, event) {\n  // now we have access to the native event\n  if (event) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n  }\n  alert(message)\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nmethods: {\n  warn(message, event) {\n    // now we have access to the native event\n    if (event) {\n      event.preventDefault()\n    }\n    alert(message)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Event Modifiers\n\nIt is a very common need to call `event.preventDefault()` or `event.stopPropagation()` inside event handlers. Although we can do this easily inside methods, it would be better if the methods can be purely about data logic rather than having to deal with DOM event details.\n\nTo address this problem, Vue provides **event modifiers** for `v-on`. Recall that modifiers are directive postfixes denoted by a dot.\n\n- `.stop`\n- `.prevent`\n- `.self`\n- `.capture`\n- `.once`\n- `.passive`\n\n``` template\n<!-- the click event's propagation will be stopped -->\n<a @click.stop=\"doThis\"></a>\n\n<!-- the submit event will no longer reload the page -->\n<form @submit.prevent=\"onSubmit\"></form>\n\n<!-- modifiers can be chained -->\n<a @click.stop.prevent=\"doThat\"></a>\n\n<!-- just the modifier -->\n<form @submit.prevent></form>\n\n<!-- only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself -->\n<!-- i.e. not from a child element -->\n<div @click.self=\"doThat\">...</div>\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nOrder matters when using modifiers because the relevant code is generated in the same order. Therefore using `@click.prevent.self` will prevent **click's default action on the element itself and its children**, while `@click.self.prevent` will only prevent click's default action on the element itself.\n\nThe `.capture`, `.once`, and `.passive` modifiers mirror the [options of the native `addEventListener` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#options):\n\n``` template\n<!-- use capture mode when adding the event listener -->\n<!-- i.e. an event targeting an inner element is handled here before being handled by that element -->\n<div @click.capture=\"doThis\">...</div>\n\n<!-- the click event will be triggered at most once -->\n<a @click.once=\"doThis\"></a>\n\n<!-- the scroll event's default behavior (scrolling) will happen -->\n<!-- immediately, instead of waiting for `onScroll` to complete  -->\n<!-- in case it contains `event.preventDefault()`                -->\n<div @scroll.passive=\"onScroll\">...</div>\n```\n\nThe `.passive` modifier is typically used with touch event listeners for [improving performance on mobile devices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#improving_scroll_performance_using_passive_listeners).\n\n**TIP**\n\nDo not use `.passive` and `.prevent` together, because `.passive` already indicates to the browser that you *do not* intend to prevent the event's default behavior, and you will likely see a warning from the browser if you do so.\n\n## Key Modifiers\n\nWhen listening for keyboard events, we often need to check for specific keys. Vue allows adding key modifiers for `v-on` or `@` when listening for key events:\n\n``` template\n<!-- only call `submit` when the `key` is `Enter` -->\n<input @keyup.enter=\"submit\" />\n```\n\nYou can directly use any valid key names exposed via [`KeyboardEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) as modifiers by converting them to kebab-case.\n\n``` template\n<input @keyup.page-down=\"onPageDown\" />\n```\n\nIn the above example, the handler will only be called if `$event.key` is equal to `'PageDown'`.\n\n### Key Aliases\n\nVue provides aliases for the most commonly used keys:\n\n- `.enter`\n- `.tab`\n- `.delete` (captures both \"Delete\" and \"Backspace\" keys)\n- `.esc`\n- `.space`\n- `.up`\n- `.down`\n- `.left`\n- `.right`\n\n### System Modifier Keys\n\nYou can use the following modifiers to trigger mouse or keyboard event listeners only when the corresponding modifier key is pressed:\n\n- `.ctrl`\n- `.alt`\n- `.shift`\n- `.meta`\n\n**Note**\n\nOn Macintosh keyboards, meta is the command key (⌘). On Windows keyboards, meta is the Windows key (⊞). On Sun Microsystems keyboards, meta is marked as a solid diamond (◆). On certain keyboards, specifically MIT and Lisp machine keyboards and successors, such as the Knight keyboard, space-cadet keyboard, meta is labeled “META”. On Symbolics keyboards, meta is labeled “META” or “Meta”.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` template\n<!-- Alt + Enter -->\n<input @keyup.alt.enter=\"clear\" />\n\n<!-- Ctrl + Click -->\n<div @click.ctrl=\"doSomething\">Do something</div>\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nNote that modifier keys are different from regular keys and when used with `keyup` events, they have to be pressed when the event is emitted. In other words, `keyup.ctrl` will only trigger if you release a key while holding down `ctrl`. It won't trigger if you release the `ctrl` key alone.\n\n### `.exact` Modifier\n\nThe `.exact` modifier allows control of the exact combination of system modifiers needed to trigger an event.\n\n``` template\n<!-- this will fire even if Alt or Shift is also pressed -->\n<button @click.ctrl=\"onClick\">A</button>\n\n<!-- this will only fire when Ctrl and no other keys are pressed -->\n<button @click.ctrl.exact=\"onCtrlClick\">A</button>\n\n<!-- this will only fire when no system modifiers are pressed -->\n<button @click.exact=\"onClick\">A</button>\n```\n\n## Mouse Button Modifiers\n\n- `.left`\n- `.right`\n- `.middle`\n\nThese modifiers restrict the handler to events triggered by a specific mouse button.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling)"

  summary: When dealing with forms on the frontend, we often need to sync the state of form input elements with corresponding state in JavaScript
  description: "# Form Input Bindings\n\nWhen dealing with forms on the frontend, we often need to sync the state of form input elements with corresponding state in JavaScript. It can be cumbersome to manually wire up value bindings and change event listeners:\n\n``` template\n<input\n  :value=\"text\"\n  @input=\"event => text = event.target.value\">\n```\n\nThe `v-model` directive helps us simplify the above to:\n\n``` template\n<input v-model=\"text\">\n```\n\nIn addition, `v-model` can be used on inputs of different types, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements. It automatically expands to different DOM property and event pairs based on the element it is used on:\n\n- `<input>` with text types and `<textarea>` elements use `value` property and `input` event;\n- `<input type=\"checkbox\">` and `<input type=\"radio\">` use `checked` property and `change` event;\n- `<select>` uses `value` as a prop and `change` as an event.\n\n**Note**\n\n`v-model` will ignore the initial `value`, `checked` or `selected` attributes found on any form elements. It will always treat the current bound JavaScript state as the source of truth. You should declare the initial value on the JavaScript side, using the [`data`](../../api/options-state#data) option[reactivity APIs](../../api/reactivity-core#reactivity-api-core).\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Text\n\n``` template\n<p>Message is: {{ message }}</p>\n<input v-model=\"message\" placeholder=\"edit me\" />\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jUEOgyAQRa8yYUO7aNkbNOkBegM2RseWRGACoxvC3TumxuX/+f+9ql5Ez31D1SlbpuyJoSBvNLjoA6XMUCHjAg2WnAJomWoXXZxSLAwBSxk/CP2xuWl9d9GaP0YAEhgDrSOjJABLw/s8+NJBrde/NWsOpWPrI20M+yOkGdfeqXPiFAhowm9aZ8zS4+wPv/RGjtZcJtV+YpNK1g==)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jdEKwjAMRX8l9EV90L2POvAD/IO+lDVqoetCmw6h9N/NmBuEJPeSc1PVg+i2FFS90nlMnngwEb80JwaHL1sCQzURwFm258u2AyTkkuKuACbM2b6xh9Nps9o6pEnp7ggWwThRsIyiADQNz40En3uodQ+C1nRHK8HaRyoMy3WaHYa7Uf8To0CCRvzMwWESH51n4cXvBNTd8Um1H0FuTq0=)\n\n**Note**\n\nFor languages that require an [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) (Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc.), you'll notice that `v-model` doesn't get updated during IME composition. If you want to respond to these updates as well, use your own `input` event listener and `value` binding instead of using `v-model`.\n\n### Multiline text\n\n``` template\n<span>Multiline message is:</span>\n<p style=\"white-space: pre-line;\">{{ message }}</p>\n<textarea v-model=\"message\" placeholder=\"add multiple lines\"></textarea>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jktuwzAMRK9CaON24XrvKgZ6gN5AG8FmGgH6ECKdJjB891D5LYec9zCb+SH6Oq9oRmN5roEEGGWlyeWQqFSBDSoeYYdjLQk6rXYuuzyXzAIJmf0fwqF1Prru02U7PDQq0CCYKHrBlsQy+Tz9rlFCDBnfdOBRqfa7twhYrhEPzvyfgmCvnxlHoIp9w76dmbbtDe+7HdpaBQUv4it6OPepLBjV8Gw5AzpjxlOJC1a9+2WB1IZQRGhWVqsdXgb1tfDcbvYbJDRqLQ==)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNo9jk2OwyAMha9isenMIpN9hok0B+gN2FjBbZEIscDpj6LcvaZpKiHg2X6f32L+mX+uM5nO2DLkwNK7RHeesoCnE85RYHEJwKPg1/f2B8gkc067AhipFDxTB4fDVlrro5ce237AKoRGjihUldjCmPqjLgkxJNoxEEqnrtp7TTEUeUT6c+Z2CUKNdgbdxZmaavt1pl+Wj3ldbcubUegumAnh2oyTp6iE95QzoDEGukzRU9Y6eg9jDcKRoFKLUm27E5RXxTu7WZ89/G4E)\n\nNote that interpolation inside `<textarea>` won't work.

We can use `v-bind` to achieve that. In addition, using `v-bind` allows us to bind the input value to non-string values.\n\n### Checkbox\n\n``` template\n<input\n  type=\"checkbox\"\n  v-model=\"toggle\"\n  true-value=\"yes\"\n  false-value=\"no\" />\n```\n\n`true-value` and `false-value` are Vue-specific attributes that only work with `v-model`. Here the `toggle` property's value will be set to `'yes'` when the box is checked, and set to `'no'` when unchecked. You can also bind them to dynamic values using `v-bind`:\n\n``` template\n<input\n  type=\"checkbox\"\n  v-model=\"toggle\"\n  :true-value=\"dynamicTrueValue\"\n  :false-value=\"dynamicFalseValue\" />\n```\n\n**Tip**\n\nThe `true-value` and `false-value` attributes don't affect the input's `value` attribute, because browsers don't include unchecked boxes in form submissions. To guarantee that one of two values is submitted in a form (e.g. \"yes\" or \"no\"), use radio inputs instead.\n\n### Radio\n\n``` template\n<input type=\"radio\" v-model=\"pick\" :value=\"first\" />\n<input type=\"radio\" v-model=\"pick\" :value=\"second\" />\n```\n\n`pick` will be set to the value of `first` when the first radio input is checked, and set to the value of `second` when the second one is checked.\n\n### Select Options\n\n``` template\n<select v-model=\"selected\">\n  <!-- inline object literal -->\n  <option :value=\"{ number: 123 }\">123</option>\n</select>\n```\n\n`v-model` supports value bindings of non-string values as well! In the above example, when the option is selected, `selected` will be set to the object literal value of `{ number: 123 }`.\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### `.lazy`\n\nBy default, `v-model` syncs the input with the data after each `input` event (with the exception of IME composition as [stated above](#vmodel-ime-tip)). You can add the `lazy` modifier to instead sync after `change` events:\n\n``` template\n<!-- synced after \"change\" instead of \"input\" -->\n<input v-model.lazy=\"msg\" />\n```\n\n### `.number`\n\nIf you want user input to be automatically typecast as a number, you can add the `number` modifier to your `v-model` managed inputs:\n\n``` template\n<input v-model.number=\"age\" />\n```\n\nIf the value cannot be parsed with `parseFloat()`, then the original value is used instead.\n\nThe `number` modifier is applied automatically if the input has `type=\"number\"`.\n\n### `.trim`\n\nIf you want whitespace from user input to be trimmed automatically, you can add the `trim` modifier to your `v-model`-managed inputs:\n\n``` template\n<input v-model.trim=\"msg\" />\n```\n\n## `v-model` with Components\n\n> If you're not yet familiar with Vue's components, you can skip this for now.\n\nHTML's built-in input types won't always meet your needs. Fortunately, Vue components allow you to build reusable inputs with completely customized behavior. These inputs even work with `v-model`! To learn more, read about [Usage with `v-model`](../components/v-model) in the Components guide.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/forms](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/forms)"

  summary: Each Vue component instance goes through a series of initialization steps when it's created - for example, it needs to set up data observation, compile the template, mount the instance to the DOM, and update the DOM when data changes
  description: "# Lifecycle Hooks\n\nEach Vue component instance goes through a series of initialization steps when it's created - for example, it needs to set up data observation, compile the template, mount the instance to the DOM, and update the DOM when data changes. Along the way, it also runs functions called lifecycle hooks, giving users the opportunity to add their own code at specific stages.\n\n## Registering Lifecycle Hooks\n\nFor example, the `onMounted``mounted` hook can be used to run code after the component has finished the initial rendering and created the DOM nodes:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { onMounted } from 'vue'\n\nonMounted(() => {\n  console.log(`the component is now mounted.`)\n})\n</script>\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  mounted() {\n    console.log(`the component is now mounted.`)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere are also other hooks which will be called at different stages of the instance's lifecycle, with the most commonly used being [`onMounted`](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onmounted), [`onUpdated`](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onupdated), and [`onUnmounted`](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onunmounted).[`mounted`](../../api/options-lifecycle#mounted), [`updated`](../../api/options-lifecycle#updated), and [`unmounted`](../../api/options-lifecycle#unmounted).\n\nAll lifecycle hooks are called with their `this` context pointing to the current active instance invoking it. Note this means you should avoid using arrow functions when declaring lifecycle hooks, as you won't be able to access the component instance via `this` if you do so.\n\nWhen calling `onMounted`, Vue automatically associates the registered callback function with the current active component instance. This requires these hooks to be registered **synchronously** during component setup. For example, do not do this:\n\n``` js\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  onMounted(() => {\n    // this won't work.\n  })\n}, 100)\n```\n\nDo note this doesn't mean that the call must be placed lexically inside `setup()` or `<script setup>`. `onMounted()` can be called in an external function as long as the call stack is synchronous and originates from within `setup()`.\n\n## Lifecycle Diagram\n\nBelow is a diagram for the instance lifecycle. You don't need to fully understand everything going on right now, but as you learn and build more, it will be a useful reference.\n\nConsult the [Lifecycle Hooks API reference](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle)[Lifecycle Hooks API reference](../../api/options-lifecycle) for details on all lifecycle hooks and their respective use cases.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle)"

  summary: Computed properties allow us to declaratively compute derived values
  description: "# Watchers\n\n## Basic Example\n\nComputed properties allow us to declaratively compute derived values. However, there are cases where we need to perform \"side effects\" in reaction to state changes - for example, mutating the DOM, or changing another piece of state based on the result of an async operation.\n\nWith the Options API, we can use the [`watch` option](../../api/options-state#watch) to trigger a function whenever a reactive property changes:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      question: '',\n      answer: 'Questions usually contain a question mark. ;-)',\n      loading: false\n    }\n  },\n  watch: {\n    // whenever question changes, this function will run\n    question(newQuestion, oldQuestion) {\n      if (newQuestion.includes('?')) {\n        this.getAnswer()\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    async getAnswer() {\n      this.loading = true\n      this.answer = 'Thinking...'\n      try {\n        const res = await fetch('https://yesno.wtf/api')\n        this.answer = (await res.json()).answer\n      } catch (error) {\n        this.answer = 'Error!

Expressions are not supported.\n    'some.nested.key'(newValue) {\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith Composition API, we can use the [`watch` function](../../api/reactivity-core#watch) to trigger a callback whenever a piece of reactive state changes:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, watch } from 'vue'\n\nconst question = ref('')\nconst answer = ref('Questions usually contain a question mark. ;-)')\nconst loading = ref(false)\n\n// watch works directly on a ref\nwatch(question, async (newQuestion, oldQuestion) => {\n  if (newQuestion.includes('?')) {\n    loading.value = true\n    answer.value = 'Thinking...'\n    try {\n      const res = await fetch('https://yesno.wtf/api')\n      answer.value = (await res.json()).answer\n    } catch (error) {\n      answer.value = 'Error!

If you want the callback to fire on all nested mutations, you need to use a deep watcher:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  watch: {\n    someObject: {\n      handler(newValue, oldValue) {\n        // Note: `newValue` will be equal to `oldValue` here\n        // on nested mutations as long as the object itself\n        // hasn't been replaced.\n      },\n      deep: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you call `watch()` directly on a reactive object, it will implicitly create a deep watcher - the callback will be triggered on all nested mutations:\n\n``` js\nconst obj = reactive({ count: 0 })\n\nwatch(obj, (newValue, oldValue) => {\n  // fires on nested property mutations\n  // Note: `newValue` will be equal to `oldValue` here\n  // because they both point to the same object!\n})\n\nobj.count++\n```\n\nThis should be differentiated with a getter that returns a reactive object - in the latter case, the callback will only fire if the getter returns a different object:\n\n``` js\nwatch(\n  () => state.someObject,\n  () => {\n    // fires only when state.someObject is replaced\n  }\n)\n```\n\nYou can, however, force the second case into a deep watcher by explicitly using the `deep` option:\n\n``` js\nwatch(\n  () => state.someObject,\n  (newValue, oldValue) => {\n    // Note: `newValue` will be equal to `oldValue` here\n    // *unless* state.someObject has been replaced\n  },\n  { deep: true }\n)\n```\n\n**Use with Caution**\n\nDeep watch requires traversing all nested properties in the watched object, and can be expensive when used on large data structures. Use it only when necessary and beware of the performance implications.\n\n## Eager Watchers\n\n`watch` is lazy by default: the callback won't be called until the watched source has changed. But in some cases we may want the same callback logic to be run eagerly - for example, we may want to fetch some initial data, and then re-fetch the data whenever relevant state changes.\n\nWe can force a watcher's callback to be executed immediately by declaring it using an object with a `handler` function and the `immediate: true` option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  watch: {\n    question: {\n      handler(newQuestion) {\n        // this will be run immediately on component creation.\n      },\n      // force eager callback execution\n      immediate: true\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe initial execution of the handler function will happen just before the `created` hook. Vue will have already processed the `data`, `computed`, and `methods` options, so those properties will be available on the first invocation.\n\nWe can force a watcher's callback to be executed immediately by passing the `immediate: true` option:\n\n``` js\nwatch(\n  source,\n  (newValue, oldValue) => {\n    // executed immediately, then again when `source` changes\n  },\n  { immediate: true }\n)\n```\n\n## `watchEffect()`\n\nIt is common for the watcher callback to use exactly the same reactive state as the source. For example, consider the following code, which uses a watcher to load a remote resource whenever the `todoId` ref changes:\n\n``` js\nconst todoId = ref(1)\nconst data = ref(null)\n\nwatch(\n  todoId,\n  async () => {\n    const response = await fetch(\n      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${todoId.value}`\n    )\n    data.value = await response.json()\n  },\n  { immediate: true }\n)\n```\n\nIn particular, notice how the watcher uses `todoId` twice, once as the source and then again inside the callback.\n\nThis can be simplified with [`watchEffect()`](../../api/reactivity-core#watcheffect). `watchEffect()` allows us to track the callback's reactive dependencies automatically. The watcher above can be rewritten as:\n\n``` js\nwatchEffect(async () => {\n  const response = await fetch(\n    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${todoId.value}`\n  )\n  data.value = await response.json()\n})\n```\n\nHere, the callback will run immediately, there's no need to specify `immediate: true`. During its execution, it will automatically track `todoId.value` as a dependency (similar to computed properties). Whenever `todoId.value` changes, the callback will be run again. With `watchEffect()`, we no longer need to pass `todoId` explicitly as the source value.\n\nYou can check out [this example](https://vuejs.org/examples/#fetching-data) of `watchEffect()` and reactive data-fetching in action.\n\nFor examples like these, with only one dependency, the benefit of `watchEffect()` is relatively small. But for watchers that have multiple dependencies, using `watchEffect()` removes the burden of having to maintain the list of dependencies manually. In addition, if you need to watch several properties in a nested data structure, `watchEffect()` may prove more efficient than a deep watcher, as it will only track the properties that are used in the callback, rather than recursively tracking all of them.\n\n**TIP**\n\n`watchEffect` only tracks dependencies during its **synchronous** execution. When using it with an async callback, only properties accessed before the first `await` tick will be tracked.\n\n### `watch` vs. `watchEffect`\n\n`watch` and `watchEffect` both allow us to reactively perform side effects. Their main difference is the way they track their reactive dependencies:\n\n- `watch` only tracks the explicitly watched source. It won't track anything accessed inside the callback. In addition, the callback only triggers when the source has actually changed. `watch` separates dependency tracking from the side effect, giving us more precise control over when the callback should fire.\n\n- `watchEffect`, on the other hand, combines dependency tracking and side effect into one phase. It automatically tracks every reactive property accessed during its synchronous execution. This is more convenient and typically results in terser code, but makes its reactive dependencies less explicit.\n\n## Callback Flush Timing\n\nWhen you mutate reactive state, it may trigger both Vue component updates and watcher callbacks created by you.\n\nBy default, user-created watcher callbacks are called **before** Vue component updates. This means if you attempt to access the DOM inside a watcher callback, the DOM will be in the state before Vue has applied any updates.\n\nIf you want to access the DOM in a watcher callback **after** Vue has updated it, you need to specify the `flush: 'post'` option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  watch: {\n    key: {\n      handler() {},\n      flush: 'post'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nwatch(source, callback, {\n  flush: 'post'\n})\n\nwatchEffect(callback, {\n  flush: 'post'\n})\n```\n\nPost-flush `watchEffect()` also has a convenience alias, `watchPostEffect()`:\n\n``` js\nimport { watchPostEffect } from 'vue'\n\nwatchPostEffect(() => {\n  /* executed after Vue updates */\n})\n```\n\n## `this.$watch()`\n\nIt's also possible to imperatively create watchers using the [`$watch()` instance method](../../api/component-instance#watch):\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  created() {\n    this.$watch('question', (newQuestion) => {\n      // ...\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is useful when you need to conditionally set up a watcher, or only watch something in response to user interaction. It also allows you to stop the watcher early.\n\n## Stopping a Watcher\n\nWatchers declared using the `watch` option or the `$watch()` instance method are automatically stopped when the owner component is unmounted, so in most cases you don't need to worry about stopping the watcher yourself.\n\nIn the rare case where you need to stop a watcher before the owner component unmounts, the `$watch()` API returns a function for that:\n\n``` js\nconst unwatch = this.$watch('foo', callback)\n\n// ...when the watcher is no longer needed:\nunwatch()\n```\n\nWatchers declared synchronously inside `setup()` or `<script setup>` are bound to the owner component instance, and will be automatically stopped when the owner component is unmounted. In most cases, you don't need to worry about stopping the watcher yourself.\n\nThe key here is that the watcher must be created **synchronously**: if the watcher is created in an async callback, it won't be bound to the owner component and must be stopped manually to avoid memory leaks. Here's an example:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { watchEffect } from 'vue'\n\n// this one will be automatically stopped\nwatchEffect(() => {})\n\n// ...this one will not!\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  watchEffect(() => {})\n}, 100)\n</script>\n```\n\nTo manually stop a watcher, use the returned handle function. This works for both `watch` and `watchEffect`:\n\n``` js\nconst unwatch = watchEffect(() => {})\n\n// ...later, when no longer needed\nunwatch()\n```\n\nNote that there should be very few cases where you need to create watchers asynchronously, and synchronous creation should be preferred whenever possible. If you need to wait for some async data, you can make your watch logic conditional instead:\n\n``` js\n// data to be loaded asynchronously\nconst data = ref(null)\n\nwatchEffect(() => {\n  if (data.value) {\n    // do something when data is loaded\n  }\n})\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers)"

  summary: While Vue's declarative rendering model abstracts away most of the direct DOM operations for you, there may still be cases where we need direct access to the underlying DOM elements
  description: "# Template Refs\n\nWhile Vue's declarative rendering model abstracts away most of the direct DOM operations for you, there may still be cases where we need direct access to the underlying DOM elements. To achieve this, we can use the special `ref` attribute:\n\n``` template\n<input ref=\"input\">\n```\n\n`ref` is a special attribute, similar to the `key` attribute discussed in the `v-for` chapter. It allows us to obtain a direct reference to a specific DOM element or child component instance after it's mounted. This may be useful when you want to, for example, programmatically focus an input on component mount, or initialize a 3rd party library on an element.\n\n## Accessing the Refs\n\nTo obtain the reference with Composition API, we need to declare a ref with a name that matches the template ref attribute's value:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\n// declare a ref to hold the element reference\n// the name must match template ref value\nconst input = ref(null)\n\nonMounted(() => {\n  input.value.focus()\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input ref=\"input\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nIf not using `<script setup>`, make sure to also return the ref from `setup()`:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const input = ref(null)\n    // ...\n    return {\n      input\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe resulting ref is exposed on `this.$refs`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  mounted() {\n    this.$refs.input.focus()\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input ref=\"input\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nNote that you can only access the ref **after the component is mounted.** If you try to access `$refs.input``input` in a template expression, it will be `undefined``null` on the first render. This is because the element doesn't exist until after the first render!\n\nIf you are trying to watch the changes of a template ref, make sure to account for the case where the ref has `null` value:\n\n``` js\nwatchEffect(() => {\n  if (input.value) {\n    input.value.focus()\n  } else {\n    // not mounted yet, or the element was unmounted (e.g. by v-if)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nSee also: [Typing Template Refs](../typescript/composition-api#typing-template-refs)\n\n## Refs inside `v-for`\n\n> Requires v3.2.25 or above\n\nWhen `ref` is used inside `v-for`, the corresponding ref should contain an Array value, which will be populated with the elements after mount:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\nconst list = ref([\n  /* ... */\n])\n\nconst itemRefs = ref([])\n\nonMounted(() => console.log(itemRefs.value))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ul>\n    <li v-for=\"item in list\" ref=\"itemRefs\">\n      {{ item }}\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpFjs1qwzAQhF9l0CU2uDZtb8UOlJ576bXqwaQyCGRJyCsTEHr3rGwnOehnd2e+nSQ+vW/XqMSH6JdL0J6wKIr+LK2evQuEhKCmBs5+u2hJ/SNjCm7GiV0naaW9OLsQjOZrKNrq97XBW4P3v/o51qTmHzUtd8k+e0CrqsZwRpIWGI0KVN0N7TqaqNp59JUuEt2SutKXY5elmimZT9/t2Tk1F+z0ZiTFFdBHs738Mxrry+TCIEWhQ9sttRQl0tEsK6U4HEBKW3LkfDA6o3dst3H77rFM5BtTfm/P)\n\nWhen `ref` is used inside `v-for`, the resulting ref value will be an array containing the corresponding elements:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      list: [\n        /* ... */\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    console.log(this.$refs.items)\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ul>\n    <li v-for=\"item in list\" ref=\"items\">\n      {{ item }}\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpFjk0KwjAQha/yCC4Uaou6kyp4DuOi2KkGYhKSiQildzdNa4WQmTc/37xeXJwr35HEUdTh7pXjszT0cdYzWuqaqBm9NEDbcLPeTDngiaM3PwVoFfiI667AvsDhNpWHMQzF+L9sNEztH3C3JlhNpbaPNT9VKFeeulAqplfY5D1p0qurxVQSqel0w5QUUEedY8q0wnvbWX+SYgRAmWxIiuSzm4tBinkc6HvkuSE7TIBKq4lZZWhdLZfE8AWp4l3T)\n\nIt should be noted that the ref array does **not** guarantee the same order as the source array.\n\n## Function Refs\n\nInstead of a string key, the `ref` attribute can also be bound to a function, which will be called on each component update and gives you full flexibility on where to store the element reference. The function receives the element reference as the first argument:\n\n``` template\n<input :ref=\"(el) => { /* assign el to a property or ref */ }\">\n```\n\nNote we are using a dynamic `:ref` binding so we can pass it a function instead of a ref name string. When the element is unmounted, the argument will be `null`. You can, of course, use a method instead of an inline function.\n\n## Ref on Component\n\n> This section assumes knowledge of [Components](component-basics). Feel free to skip it and come back later.\n\n`ref` can also be used on a child component. In this case the reference will be that of a component instance:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\nimport Child from './Child.vue'\n\nconst child = ref(null)\n\nonMounted(() => {\n  // child.value will hold an instance of <Child />\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <Child ref=\"child\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nimport Child from './Child.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    Child\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    // this.$refs.child will hold an instance of <Child />\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <Child ref=\"child\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nIf the child component is using Options API or not using `<script setup>`, theThe referenced instance will be identical to the child component's `this`, which means the parent component will have full access to every property and method of the child component. This makes it easy to create tightly coupled implementation details between the parent and the child, so component refs should be only used when absolutely needed - in most cases, you should try to implement parent / child interactions using the standard props and emit interfaces first.\n\nAn exception here is that components using `<script setup>` are **private by default**: a parent component referencing a child component using `<script setup>` won't be able to access anything unless the child component chooses to expose a public interface using the `defineExpose` macro:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst a = 1\nconst b = ref(2)\n\n// Compiler macros, such as defineExpose, don't need to be imported\ndefineExpose({\n  a,\n  b\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nWhen a parent gets an instance of this component via template refs, the retrieved instance will be of the shape `{ a: number, b: number }` (refs are automatically unwrapped just like on normal instances).\n\nSee also: [Typing Component Template Refs](../typescript/composition-api#typing-component-template-refs)\n\nThe `expose` option can be used to limit the access to a child instance:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  expose: ['publicData', 'publicMethod'],\n  data() {\n    return {\n      publicData: 'foo',\n      privateData: 'bar'\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    publicMethod() {\n      /* ... */\n    },\n    privateMethod() {\n      /* ... */\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, a parent referencing this component via template ref will only be able to access `publicData` and `publicMethod`.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs)"

  summary: Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation
  description: "# Components Basics\n\nComponents allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. It's common for an app to be organized into a tree of nested components:\n\nThis is very similar to how we nest native HTML elements, but Vue implements its own component model that allows us to encapsulate custom content and logic in each component. Vue also plays nicely with native Web Components. If you are curious about the relationship between Vue Components and native Web Components, [read more here](../extras/web-components).\n\n## Defining a Component\n\nWhen using a build step, we typically define each Vue component in a dedicated file using the `.vue` extension - known as a [Single-File Component](../scaling-up/sfc) (SFC for short):\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"count++\">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</button>\n</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"count++\">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</button>\n</template>\n```\n\nWhen not using a build step, a Vue component can be defined as a plain JavaScript object containing Vue-specific options:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    <button @click=\"count++\">\n      You clicked me {{ count }} times.\n    </button>`\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n    return { count }\n  },\n  template: `\n    <button @click=\"count++\">\n      You clicked me {{ count }} times.\n    </button>`\n  // Can also target an in-DOM template:\n  // template: '#my-template-element'\n}\n```\n\nThe template is inlined as a JavaScript string here, which Vue will compile on the fly. You can also use an ID selector pointing to an element (usually native `<template>` elements) - Vue will use its content as the template source.\n\nThe example above defines a single component and exports it as the default export of a `.js` file, but you can use named exports to export multiple components from the same file.\n\n## Using a Component\n\n**TIP**\n\nWe will be using SFC syntax for the rest of this guide - the concepts around components are the same regardless of whether you are using a build step or not. The [Examples](https://vuejs.org/examples/) section shows component usage in both scenarios.\n\nTo use a child component, we need to import it in the parent component. Assuming we placed our counter component inside a file called `ButtonCounter.vue`, the component will be exposed as the file's default export:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nimport ButtonCounter from './ButtonCounter.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ButtonCounter\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <h1>Here is a child component!</h1>\n  <ButtonCounter />\n</template>\n```\n\nTo expose the imported component to our template, we need to [register](../components/registration) it with the `components` option. The component will then be available as a tag using the key it is registered under.\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport ButtonCounter from './ButtonCounter.vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <h1>Here is a child component!</h1>\n  <ButtonCounter />\n</template>\n```\n\nWith `<script setup>`, imported components are automatically made available to the template.\n\nIt's also possible to globally register a component, making it available to all components in a given app without having to import it. The pros and cons of global vs. local registration is discussed in the dedicated [Component Registration](../components/registration) section.\n\nComponents can be reused as many times as you want:\n\n``` template\n<h1>Here are many child components!</h1>\n<ButtonCounter />\n<ButtonCounter />\n<ButtonCounter />\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqVUE1LxDAQ/StjLqusNHotcfHj4l8QcontLBtsJiGdiFL6301SdrEqyEJyeG9m3ps3k3gIoXlPKFqhxi7awDtN1gUfGR4Ts6cnn4gxwj56B5tGrtgyutEEoAk/6lCPe5MGhqmwnc9KhMRjuxCwFi3UrCk/JU/uGTC6MBjGglgdbnfPGBFM/s7QJ3QHO/TfxC+UzD21d72zPItU8uQrrsWvnKsT/ZW2N2wur45BI3KKdETlFlmphZsF58j/RgdQr3UJuO8G273daVFFtlstahngxSeoNezBIUzTYgPzDGwdjk1VkYvMj4jzF0nwsyQ=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqVj91KAzEQhV/lmJsqlY3eSlr8ufEVhNys6ZQGNz8kE0GWfXez2SJUsdCLuZiZM9+ZM4qnGLvPQuJBqGySjYxMXOJWe+tiSIznwhz8SyieKWGfgsOqkyfTGbDSXsmFUG9rw+Ti0DPNHavD/faVEqGv5Xr/BXOwww4mVBNPnvOVklXTtKeO8qKhkj++4lb8+fL/mCMS7TEdAy6BtDfBZ65fVgA2s+L67uZMUEC9N0s8msGaj40W7Xa91qKtgbdQ0Ha0gyOM45E+TWDrKHeNIhfMr0DTN4U0me8=)\n\nNotice that when clicking on the buttons, each one maintains its own, separate `count`. That's because each time you use a component, a new **instance** of it is created.\n\nIn SFCs, it's recommended to use `PascalCase` tag names for child components to differentiate from native HTML elements. Although native HTML tag names are case-insensitive, Vue SFC is a compiled format so we are able to use case-sensitive tag names in it. We are also able to use `/>` to close a tag.\n\nIf you are authoring your templates directly in a DOM (e.g. as the content of a native `<template>` element), the template will be subject to the browser's native HTML parsing behavior. In such cases, you will need to use `kebab-case` and explicit closing tags for components:\n\n``` template\n<!-- if this template is written in the DOM -->\n<button-counter></button-counter>\n<button-counter></button-counter>\n<button-counter></button-counter>\n```\n\nSee [in-DOM template parsing caveats](#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats) for more details.\n\n## Passing Props\n\nIf we are building a blog, we will likely need a component representing a blog post. We want all the blog posts to share the same visual layout, but with different content. Such a component won't be useful unless you can pass data to it, such as the title and content of the specific post we want to display. That's where props come in.\n\nProps are custom attributes you can register on a component. To pass a title to our blog post component, we must declare it in the list of props this component accepts, using the [`props`](../../api/options-state#props) option[`defineProps`](../../api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits) macro:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- BlogPost.vue -->\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: ['title']\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <h4>{{ title }}</h4>\n</template>\n```\n\nWhen a value is passed to a prop attribute, it becomes a property on that component instance. The value of that property is accessible within the template and on the component's `this` context, just like any other component property.\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- BlogPost.vue -->\n<script setup>\ndefineProps(['title'])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <h4>{{ title }}</h4>\n</template>\n```\n\n`defineProps` is a compile-time macro that is only available inside `<script setup>` and does not need to be explicitly imported. Declared props are automatically exposed to the template. `defineProps` also returns an object that contains all the props passed to the component, so that we can access them in JavaScript if needed:\n\n``` js\nconst props = defineProps(['title'])\nconsole.log(props.title)\n```\n\nSee also: [Typing Component Props](../typescript/composition-api#typing-component-props)\n\nIf you are not using `<script setup>`, props should be declared using the `props` option, and the props object will be passed to `setup()` as the first argument:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['title'],\n  setup(props) {\n    console.log(props.title)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA component can have as many props as you like and, by default, any value can be passed to any prop.\n\nOnce a prop is registered, you can pass data to it as a custom attribute, like this:\n\n``` template\n<BlogPost title=\"My journey with Vue\" />\n<BlogPost title=\"Blogging with Vue\" />\n<BlogPost title=\"Why Vue is so fun\" />\n```\n\nIn a typical app, however, you'll likely have an array of posts in your parent component:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  data() {\n    return {\n      posts: [\n        { id: 1, title: 'My journey with Vue' },\n        { id: 2, title: 'Blogging with Vue' },\n        { id: 3, title: 'Why Vue is so fun' }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst posts = ref([\n  { id: 1, title: 'My journey with Vue' },\n  { id: 2, title: 'Blogging with Vue' },\n  { id: 3, title: 'Why Vue is so fun' }\n])\n```\n\nThen want to render a component for each one, using `v-for`:\n\n``` template\n<BlogPost\n  v-for=\"post in posts\"\n  :key=\"post.id\"\n  :title=\"post.title\"\n />\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9UU1rhDAU/CtDLrawVfpxklRo74We2kPtQdaoaTUJ8bmtiP+9ia6uC2VBgjOZeXnz3sCejAkPnWAx4+3eSkNJqmRjtCU817p81S2hsLpBEEYL4Q1BqoBUid9Jmosi62rC4Nm9dn4lFLXxTGAt5dG482eeUXZ1vdxbQZ1VCwKM0zr3x4KBATKPcbsDSapFjOClx5d2JtHjR1KFN9fTsfbWcXdy+CZKqcqL+vuT/r3qvQqyRatRdMrpF/nn/DNhd7iPR+v8HCDRmDoj4RHxbfyUDjeFto8p8yEh1Rw2ZV4JxN+iP96FMvest8RTTws/gdmQ8HUr7ikere+yHduu62y//y3NWG38xIOpeODyXcoE8OohGYZ5VhhHHjl83sD4B3XgyGI=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9kU9PhDAUxL/KpBfWBCH+OZEuid5N9qSHrQezFKhC27RlDSF8d1tYQBP1+N78OpN5HciD1sm54yQj1J6M0A6Wu07nTIpWK+MwwPASI0qjWkQejVbpsVHVQVl30ZJ0WQRHjwFMnpT0gPZLi32w2h2DMEAUGW5iOOEaniF66vGuOiN5j0/hajx7B4zxxt5ubIiphKz+IO828qXugw5hYRXKTnqSydcrJmk61/VF/eB4q5s3x8Pk6FJjauDO16Uye0ZCBwg5d2EkkED2wfuLlogibMOTbMpf9tMwP8jpeiMfRdM1l8Tk+/F++Y6Cl0Lyg1Ha7o7R5Bn9WwSg9X0+DPMxMI409fPP1PELlVmwdQ==)\n\nNotice how `v-bind` is used to pass dynamic prop values. This is especially useful when you don't know the exact content you're going to render ahead of time.\n\nThat's all you need to know about props for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on [Props](../components/props).\n\n## Listening to Events\n\nAs we develop our `<BlogPost>` component, some features may require communicating back up to the parent. For example, we may decide to include an accessibility feature to enlarge the text of blog posts, while leaving the rest of the page at its default size.\n\nIn the parent, we can support this feature by adding a `postFontSize` data propertyref:\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    posts: [\n      /* ... */\n    ],\n    postFontSize: 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst posts = ref([\n  /* ... */\n])\n\nconst postFontSize = ref(1)\n```\n\nWhich can be used in the template to control the font size of all blog posts:\n\n``` template\n<div :style=\"{ fontSize: postFontSize + 'em' }\">\n  <BlogPost\n    v-for=\"post in posts\"\n    :key=\"post.id\"\n    :title=\"post.title\"\n   />\n</div>\n```\n\nNow let's add a button to the `<BlogPost>` component's template:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- BlogPost.vue, omitting <script> -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"blog-post\">\n    <h4>{{ title }}</h4>\n    <button>Enlarge text</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nThe button doesn't do anything yet - we want clicking the button to communicate to the parent that it should enlarge the text of all posts. To solve this problem, components provide a custom events system. The parent can choose to listen to any event on the child component instance with `v-on` or `@`, just as we would with a native DOM event:\n\n``` template\n<BlogPost\n  ...\n  @enlarge-text=\"postFontSize += 0.1\"\n />\n```\n\nThen the child component can emit an event on itself by calling the built-in [**`$emit`** method](../../api/component-instance#emit), passing the name of the event:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- BlogPost.vue, omitting <script> -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"blog-post\">\n    <h4>{{ title }}</h4>\n    <button @click=\"$emit('enlarge-text')\">Enlarge text</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nThanks to the `@enlarge-text=\"postFontSize += 0.1\"` listener, the parent will receive the event and update the value of `postFontSize`.\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\nWe can optionally declare emitted events using the [`emits`](../../api/options-state#emits) option[`defineEmits`](../../api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits) macro:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- BlogPost.vue -->\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: ['title'],\n  emits: ['enlarge-text']\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- BlogPost.vue -->\n<script setup>\ndefineProps(['title'])\ndefineEmits(['enlarge-text'])\n</script>\n```\n\nThis documents all the events that a component emits and optionally [validates them](../components/events#events-validation). It also allows Vue to avoid implicitly applying them as native listeners to the child component's root element.\n\nSimilar to `defineProps`, `defineEmits` is only usable in `<script setup>` and doesn't need to be imported. It returns an `emit` function that is equivalent to the `$emit` method. It can be used to emit events in the `<script setup>` section of a component, where `$emit` isn't directly accessible:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst emit = defineEmits(['enlarge-text'])\n\nemit('enlarge-text')\n</script>\n```\n\nSee also: [Typing Component Emits](../typescript/composition-api#typing-component-emits)\n\nIf you are not using `<script setup>`, you can declare emitted events using the `emits` option. You can access the `emit` function as a property of the setup context (passed to `setup()` as the second argument):\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  emits: ['enlarge-text'],\n  setup(props, ctx) {\n    ctx.emit('enlarge-text')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's all you need to know about custom component events for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on [Custom Events](../components/events).\n\n## Content Distribution with Slots\n\nJust like with HTML elements, it's often useful to be able to pass content to a component, like this:\n\n``` template\n<AlertBox>\n  Something bad happened.\n</AlertBox>\n```\n\nWhich might render something like:\n\n**This is an Error for Demo Purposes**\n\nSomething bad happened.\n\nThis can be achieved using Vue's custom `<slot>` element:\n\n``` javascript\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert-box\">\n    <strong>This is an Error for Demo Purposes</strong>\n    <slot />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n.alert-box {\n  /* ... */\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nAs you'll see above, we use the `<slot>` as a placeholder where we want the content to go – and that's it. We're done!\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpVUcFOwzAM/RUTDruwFhCaUCmThsQXcO0lbbKtIo0jx52Kpv07TreWouTynl+en52z2oWQnXqrClXGhtrA28q3XUBi2DlL/IED7Ak7WGX5RKQHq8oDVN4Oo9TYve4dwzmxDcp7bz3HAs5/LpfKyy3zuY0Atl1wmm1CXE5SQeLNX9hZPrb+ALU2cNQhWG9NNkrnLKIt89lGPahlyDTVogVAadoTNE7H+F4pnZTrGodKjUUpRyb0h+0nEdKdRL3CW7GmfNY5ZLiiMhfP/ynG0SL/OAuxwWCNMNncbVqSQyrgfrPZvCVcIxkrxFMYIKJrDZA1i8qatGl72ehLGEY6aGNkNwU8P96YWjffB8Lem/Xkvn9NR6qy+fRd14FSgopvmtQmzTT9Toq9VZdfIpa5jQ==)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpVUEtOwzAQvcpgFt3QBBCqUAiRisQJ2GbjxG4a4Xis8aQKqnp37PyUyqv3mZn3fBVH55JLr0Umcl9T6xi85t4VpW07h8RwNJr4Cwc4EXawS9KFiGO70ubpNBcmAmDdOSNZR8T5Yg0IoOQf7DSfW9tAJRWcpXPaapWM1nVt8ObpukY8ie29GHNzAiBX7QVqI73/LIWMzn2FQylGMcieCW1TfBMhPYSoE5zFitLVZ5BhQnkadt6nGKt5/jMafI1Oq8Ak6zW4xrEaDVIGj4fD4SPiCknpQLy4ATyaVgFptVH2JFXb+wze3DDSTioV/iaD1+eZqWT92xD2Vu2X7af3+IJ6G7/UToVigpJnTzwTO42eWDnELsTtH/wUqH4=)\n\nThat's all you need to know about slots for now, but once you've finished reading this page and feel comfortable with its content, we recommend coming back later to read the full guide on [Slots](../components/slots).\n\n## Dynamic Components\n\nSometimes, it's useful to dynamically switch between components, like in a tabbed interface:\n\n[Open example in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNVE2PmzAQ/Ssj9kArLSHbrXpwk1X31mMPvS17cIxJrICNbJMmivLfO/7AEG2jRiDkefP85sNmztlr3y8OA89ItjJMi96+VFJ0vdIWfqqOQ6NVB/midIYj5sn9Sxlrkt9b14RXzXbiMElEO5IAKsmPnljzhg6thbNDmcLdkktrSADAJ/IYlj5MXEc9Z1w8VFNLP30ed2luBy1HC4UHrVH2N90QyJ1kHnUALN1gtLeIQu6juEUMkb8H5sXHqiS+qzK1Cw3Lu76llqMFsKrFAVhLjVlXWc07VWUeR89msFbhhhAWDkWjNJIwPgjp06iy5CV7fgrOOTgKv+XoKIIgpnoGyiymSmZ1wnq9dqJweZ8p/GCtYHtUmBMdLXFitgDnc9ju68b0yxDO1WzRTEcFRLiUJsEqSw3wwi+rMpFDj0psEq5W5ax1aBp7at1y4foWzq5R0hYN7UR7ImCoNIXhWjTfnW+jdM01gaf+CEa1ooYHzvnMVWhaiwEP90t/9HBP61rILQJL3POMHw93VG+FLKzqUYx3c2yjsOaOwNeRO2B8zKHlzBKQWJNH1YHrplV/iiMBOliFILYNK5mOKdSTMviGCTyNojFdTKBoeWNT3s8f/Vpsd7cIV61gjHkXnotR6OqVkJbrQKdsv9VqkDWBh2bpnn8VXaDcHPexE4wFzsojO9eDUOSVPF+65wN/EW7sHRsi5XaFqaexn+EH9Xcpe8zG2eWG3O0/NVzUaeJMk+jGhUXlNPXulw5j8w7t2bi8X32cuf/Vv/wF/SL98A==)\n\n[Open example in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\nThe above is made possible by Vue's `<component>` element with the special `is` attribute:\n\n``` template\n<!-- Component changes when currentTab changes -->\n<component :is=\"currentTab\"></component>\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- Component changes when currentTab changes -->\n<component :is=\"tabs[currentTab]\"></component>\n```\n\nIn the example above, the value passed to `:is` can contain either:\n\n- the name string of a registered component, OR\n- the actual imported component object\n\nYou can also use the `is` attribute to create regular HTML elements.\n\nWhen switching between multiple components with `<component :is=\"...\">`, a component will be unmounted when it is switched away from. We can force the inactive components to stay \"alive\" with the built-in [`<KeepAlive>` component](../built-ins/keep-alive).\n\n## in-DOM Template Parsing Caveats\n\nIf you are writing your Vue templates directly in the DOM, Vue will have to retrieve the template string from the DOM. This leads to some caveats due to browsers' native HTML parsing behavior.\n\n**TIP**\n\nIt should be noted that the limitations discussed below only apply if you are writing your templates directly in the DOM. They do NOT apply if you are using string templates from the following sources:\n\n- Single-File Components\n- Inlined template strings (e.g. `template: '...'`)\n- `<script type=\"text/x-template\">`\n\n### Case Insensitivity\n\nHTML tags and attribute names are case-insensitive, so browsers will interpret any uppercase characters as lowercase. That means when you’re using in-DOM templates, PascalCase component names and camelCased prop names or `v-on` event names all need to use their kebab-cased (hyphen-delimited) equivalents:\n\n``` js\n// camelCase in JavaScript\nconst BlogPost = {\n  props: ['postTitle'],\n  emits: ['updatePost'],\n  template: `\n    <h3>{{ postTitle }}</h3>\n  `\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- kebab-case in HTML -->\n<blog-post post-title=\"hello!\" @update-post=\"onUpdatePost\"></blog-post>\n```\n\n### Self Closing Tags\n\nWe have been using self-closing tags for components in previous code samples:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent />\n```\n\nThis is because Vue's template parser respects `/>` as an indication to end any tag, regardless of its type.\n\nIn in-DOM templates, however, we must always include explicit closing tags:\n\n``` template\n<my-component></my-component>\n```\n\nThis is because the HTML spec only allows [a few specific elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements) to omit closing tags, the most common being `<input>` and `<img>`. For all other elements, if you omit the closing tag, the native HTML parser will think you never terminated the opening tag. For example, the following snippet:\n\n``` template\n<my-component /> <!-- we intend to close the tag here... -->\n<span>hello</span>\n```\n\nwill be parsed as:\n\n``` template\n<my-component>\n  <span>hello</span>\n</my-component> <!-- but the browser will close it here. -->\n```\n\n### Element Placement Restrictions\n\nSome HTML elements, such as `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>` and `<select>` have restrictions on what elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as `<li>`, `<tr>`, and `<option>` can only appear inside certain other elements.\n\nThis will lead to issues when using components with elements that have such restrictions. For example:\n\n``` template\n<table>\n  <blog-post-row></blog-post-row>\n</table>\n```\n\nThe custom component `<blog-post-row>` will be hoisted out as invalid content, causing errors in the eventual rendered output. We can use the special [`is` attribute](../../api/built-in-special-attributes#is) as a workaround:\n\n``` template\n<table>\n  <tr is=\"vue:blog-post-row\"></tr>\n</table>\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nWhen used on native HTML elements, the value of `is` must be prefixed with `vue:` in order to be interpreted as a Vue component. This is required to avoid confusion with native [customized built-in elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example).\n\nThat's all you need to know about in-DOM template parsing caveats for now - and actually, the end of Vue's *Essentials*. Congratulations! There's still more to learn, but first, we recommend taking a break to play with Vue yourself - build something fun, or check out some of the [Examples](https://vuejs.org/examples/) if you haven't already.\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with the knowledge you've just digested, move on with the guide to learn more about components in depth.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics)"

  id: guide/components/registration
  summary: This page assumes you've already read the Components Basics
  description: "# Component Registration\n\n> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](../essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.\n\nA Vue component needs to be \"registered\" so that Vue knows where to locate its implementation when it is encountered in a template. There are two ways to register components: global and local.\n\n## Global Registration\n\nWe can make components available globally in the current [Vue application](../essentials/application) using the `.component()` method:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({})\n\napp.component(\n  // the registered name\n  'MyComponent',\n  // the implementation\n  {\n    /* ... */\n  }\n)\n```\n\nIf using SFCs, you will be registering the imported `.vue` files:\n\n``` js\nimport MyComponent from './App.vue'\n\napp.component('MyComponent', MyComponent)\n```\n\nThe `.component()` method can be chained:\n\n``` js\napp\n  .component('ComponentA', ComponentA)\n  .component('ComponentB', ComponentB)\n  .component('ComponentC', ComponentC)\n```\n\nGlobally registered components can be used in the template of any component within this application:\n\n``` template\n<!-- this will work in any component inside the app -->\n<ComponentA/>\n<ComponentB/>\n<ComponentC/>\n```\n\nThis even applies to all subcomponents, meaning all three of these components will also be available *inside each other*.\n\n## Local Registration\n\nWhile convenient, global registration has a few drawbacks:\n\n1.  Global registration prevents build systems from removing unused components (a.k.a \"tree-shaking\"). If you globally register a component but end up not using it anywhere in your app, it will still be included in the final bundle.\n\n2.  Global registration makes dependency relationships less explicit in large applications. It makes it difficult to locate a child component's implementation from a parent component using it. This can affect long-term maintainability similar to using too many global variables.\n\nLocal registration scopes the availability of the registered components to the current component only. It makes the dependency relationship more explicit, and is more tree-shaking friendly.\n\nWhen using SFC with `<script setup>`, imported components can be locally used without registration:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ComponentA />\n</template>\n```\n\nIn non-`<script setup>`, you will need to use the `components` option:\n\n``` js\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.js'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ComponentA\n  },\n  setup() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLocal registration is done using the `components` option:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ComponentA\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ComponentA />\n</template>\n```\n\nFor each property in the `components` object, the key will be the registered name of the component, while the value will contain the implementation of the component. The above example is using the ES2015 property shorthand and is equivalent to:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ComponentA: ComponentA\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nNote that **locally registered components are *not* also available in descendant components**. In this case, `ComponentA` will be made available to the current component only, not any of its child or descendant components.\n\n## Component Name Casing\n\nThroughout the guide, we are using PascalCase names when registering components. This is because:\n\n1.  PascalCase names are valid JavaScript identifiers. This makes it easier to import and register components in JavaScript. It also helps IDEs with auto-completion.\n\n2.  `<PascalCase />` makes it more obvious that this is a Vue component instead of a native HTML element in templates. It also differentiates Vue components from custom elements (web components).\n\nThis is the recommended style when working with SFC or string templates. However, as discussed in [in-DOM Template Parsing Caveats](../essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats), PascalCase tags are not usable in in-DOM templates.\n\nLuckily, Vue supports resolving kebab-case tags to components registered using PascalCase. This means a component registered as `MyComponent` can be referenced in the template via both `<MyComponent>` and `<my-component>`. This allows us to use the same JavaScript component registration code regardless of template source.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration)"

Read that first if you are new to components.\n\n## Props Declaration\n\nVue components require explicit props declaration so that Vue knows what external props passed to the component should be treated as fallthrough attributes (which will be discussed in [its dedicated section](attrs)).\n\nIn SFCs using `<script setup>`, props can be declared using the `defineProps()` macro:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst props = defineProps(['foo'])\n\nconsole.log(props.foo)\n</script>\n```\n\nIn non-`<script setup>` components, props are declared using the [`props`](../../api/options-state#props) option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['foo'],\n  setup(props) {\n    // setup() receives props as the first argument.\n    console.log(props.foo)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice the argument passed to `defineProps()` is the same as the value provided to the `props` options: the same props options API is shared between the two declaration styles.\n\nProps are declared using the [`props`](../../api/options-state#props) option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['foo'],\n  created() {\n    // props are exposed on `this`\n    console.log(this.foo)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to declaring props using an array of strings, we can also use the object syntax:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    title: String,\n    likes: Number\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// in <script setup>\ndefineProps({\n  title: String,\n  likes: Number\n})\n```\n\n``` js\n// in non-<script setup>\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    title: String,\n    likes: Number\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor each property in the object declaration syntax, the key is the name of the prop, while the value should be the constructor function of the expected type.\n\nThis not only documents your component, but will also warn other developers using your component in the browser console if they pass the wrong type. We will discuss more details about [prop validation](#prop-validation) further down this page.\n\nSee also: [Typing Component Props](../typescript/options-api#typing-component-props)\n\nIf you are using TypeScript with `<script setup>`, it's also possible to declare props using pure type annotations:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ndefineProps<{\n  title?: string\n  likes?: number\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\nMore details: [Typing Component Props](../typescript/composition-api#typing-component-props)\n\n## Prop Passing Details\n\n### Prop Name Casing\n\nWe declare long prop names using camelCase because this avoids having to use quotes when using them as property keys, and allows us to reference them directly in template expressions because they are valid JavaScript identifiers:\n\n``` js\ndefineProps({\n  greetingMessage: String\n})\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    greetingMessage: String\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<span>{{ greetingMessage }}</span>\n```\n\nTechnically, you can also use camelCase when passing props to a child component (except in [in-DOM templates](../essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats)). However, the convention is using kebab-case in all cases to align with HTML attributes:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent greeting-message=\"hello\" />\n```\n\nWe use [PascalCase for component tags](registration#component-name-casing) when possible because it improves template readability by differentiating Vue components from native elements. However, there isn't as much practical benefit in using camelCase when passing props, so we choose to follow each language's conventions.\n\n### Static vs. Dynamic Props\n\nSo far, you've seen props passed as static values, like in:\n\n``` template\n<BlogPost title=\"My journey with Vue\" />\n```\n\nYou've also seen props assigned dynamically with `v-bind` or its `:` shortcut, such as in:\n\n``` template\n<!-- Dynamically assign the value of a variable -->\n<BlogPost :title=\"post.title\" />\n\n<!-- Dynamically assign the value of a complex expression -->\n<BlogPost :title=\"post.title + ' by ' + post.author.name\" />\n```\n\n### Passing Different Value Types\n\nIn the two examples above, we happen to pass string values, but *any* type of value can be passed to a prop.\n\n#### Number\n\n``` template\n<!-- Even though `42` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->\n<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.       -->\n<BlogPost :likes=\"42\" />\n\n<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->\n<BlogPost :likes=\"post.likes\" />\n```\n\n#### Boolean\n\n``` template\n<!-- Including the prop with no value will imply `true`. -->\n<BlogPost is-published />\n\n<!-- Even though `false` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->\n<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.          -->\n<BlogPost :is-published=\"false\" />\n\n<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->\n<BlogPost :is-published=\"post.isPublished\" />\n```\n\n#### Array\n\n``` template\n<!-- Even though the array is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->\n<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.            -->\n<BlogPost :comment-ids=\"[234, 266, 273]\" />\n\n<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->\n<BlogPost :comment-ids=\"post.commentIds\" />\n```\n\n#### Object\n\n``` template\n<!-- Even though the object is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->\n<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.             -->\n<BlogPost\n  :author=\"{\n    name: 'Veronica',\n    company: 'Veridian Dynamics'\n  }\"\n />\n\n<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->\n<BlogPost :author=\"post.author\" />\n```\n\n### Binding Multiple Properties Using an Object\n\nIf you want to pass all the properties of an object as props, you can use [`v-bind` without an argument](../essentials/template-syntax#dynamically-binding-multiple-attributes) (`v-bind` instead of `:prop-name`). For example, given a `post` object:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      post: {\n        id: 1,\n        title: 'My Journey with Vue'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst post = {\n  id: 1,\n  title: 'My Journey with Vue'\n}\n```\n\nThe following template:\n\n``` template\n<BlogPost v-bind=\"post\" />\n```\n\nWill be equivalent to:\n\n``` template\n<BlogPost :id=\"post.id\" :title=\"post.title\" />\n```\n\n## One-Way Data Flow\n\nAll props form a **one-way-down binding** between the child property and the parent one: when the parent property updates, it will flow down to the child, but not the other way around. This prevents child components from accidentally mutating the parent's state, which can make your app's data flow harder to understand.\n\nIn addition, every time the parent component is updated, all props in the child component will be refreshed with the latest value. This means you should **not** attempt to mutate a prop inside a child component. If you do, Vue will warn you in the console:\n\n``` js\nconst props = defineProps(['foo'])\n\n// ❌ warning, props are readonly!\nprops.foo = 'bar'\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['foo'],\n  created() {\n    // ❌ warning, props are readonly!\n    this.foo = 'bar'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere are usually two cases where it's tempting to mutate a prop:\n\n1.  **The prop is used to pass in an initial value; the child component wants to use it as a local data property afterwards.** In this case, it's best to define a local data property that uses the prop as its initial value:\n\n    ``` js\n    const props = defineProps(['initialCounter'])\n\n    // counter only uses props.initialCounter as the initial value;\n    // it is disconnected from future prop updates.\n    const counter = ref(props.initialCounter)\n    ```\n\n    ``` js\n    export default {\n      props: ['initialCounter'],\n      data() {\n        return {\n          // counter only uses this.initialCounter as the initial value;\n          // it is disconnected from future prop updates.\n          counter: this.initialCounter\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n2.  **The prop is passed in as a raw value that needs to be transformed.** In this case, it's best to define a computed property using the prop's value:\n\n    ``` js\n    const props = defineProps(['size'])\n\n    // computed property that auto-updates when the prop changes\n    const normalizedSize = computed(() => props.size.trim().toLowerCase())\n    ```\n\n    ``` js\n    export default {\n      props: ['size'],\n      computed: {\n        // computed property that auto-updates when the prop changes\n        normalizedSize() {\n          return this.size.trim().toLowerCase()\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Mutating Object / Array Props\n\nWhen objects and arrays are passed as props, while the child component cannot mutate the prop binding, it **will** be able to mutate the object or array's nested properties. This is because in JavaScript objects and arrays are passed by reference, and it is unreasonably expensive for Vue to prevent such mutations.\n\nThe main drawback of such mutations is that it allows the child component to affect parent state in a way that isn't obvious to the parent component, potentially making it more difficult to reason about the data flow in the future. As a best practice, you should avoid such mutations unless the parent and child are tightly coupled by design. In most cases, the child should [emit an event](events) to let the parent perform the mutation.\n\n## Prop Validation\n\nComponents can specify requirements for their props, such as the types you've already seen. If a requirement is not met, Vue will warn you in the browser's JavaScript console. This is especially useful when developing a component that is intended to be used by others.\n\nTo specify prop validations, you can provide an object with validation requirements to the `defineProps()` macro`props` option, instead of an array of strings. For example:\n\n``` js\ndefineProps({\n  // Basic type check\n  //  (`null` and `undefined` values will allow any type)\n  propA: Number,\n  // Multiple possible types\n  propB: [String, Number],\n  // Required string\n  propC: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  // Number with a default value\n  propD: {\n    type: Number,\n    default: 100\n  },\n  // Object with a default value\n  propE: {\n    type: Object,\n    // Object or array defaults must be returned from\n    // a factory function. The function receives the raw\n    // props received by the component as the argument.\n    default(rawProps) {\n      return { message: 'hello' }\n    }\n  },\n  // Custom validator function\n  // full props passed as 2nd argument in 3.4+\n  propF: {\n    validator(value, props) {\n      // The value must match one of these strings\n      return ['success', 'warning', 'danger'].includes(value)\n    }\n  },\n  // Function with a default value\n  propG: {\n    type: Function,\n    // Unlike object or array default, this is not a factory \n    // function - this is a function to serve as a default value\n    default() {\n      return 'Default function'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nCode inside the `defineProps()` argument **cannot access other variables declared in `<script setup>`**, because the entire expression is moved to an outer function scope when compiled.\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    // Basic type check\n    //  (`null` and `undefined` values will allow any type)\n    propA: Number,\n    // Multiple possible types\n    propB: [String, Number],\n    // Required string\n    propC: {\n      type: String,\n      required: true\n    },\n    // Number with a default value\n    propD: {\n      type: Number,\n      default: 100\n    },\n    // Object with a default value\n    propE: {\n      type: Object,\n      // Object or array defaults must be returned from\n      // a factory function. The function receives the raw\n      // props received by the component as the argument.\n      default(rawProps) {\n        return { message: 'hello' }\n      }\n    },\n    // Custom validator function\n    // full props passed as 2nd argument in 3.4+\n    propF: {\n      validator(value, props) {\n        // The value must match one of these strings\n        return ['success', 'warning', 'danger'].includes(value)\n      }\n    },\n    // Function with a default value\n    propG: {\n      type: Function,\n      // Unlike object or array default, this is not a factory \n      // function - this is a function to serve as a default value\n      default() {\n        return 'Default function'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdditional details:\n\n- All props are optional by default, unless `required: true` is specified.\n\n- An absent optional prop other than `Boolean` will have `undefined` value.\n\n- The `Boolean` absent props will be cast to `false`. You can change this by setting a `default` for it — i.e.: `default: undefined` to behave as a non-Boolean prop.\n\n- If a `default` value is specified, it will be used if the resolved prop value is `undefined` - this includes both when the prop is absent, or an explicit `undefined` value is passed.\n\nWhen prop validation fails, Vue will produce a console warning (if using the development build).\n\nIf using [Type-based props declarations](../../api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations) , Vue will try its best to compile the type annotations into equivalent runtime prop declarations. For example, `defineProps<{ msg: string }>` will be compiled into `{ msg: { type: String, required: true }}`.\n\n**Note**\n\nNote that props are validated **before** a component instance is created, so instance properties (e.g. `data`, `computed`, etc.) will not be available inside `default` or `validator` functions.\n\n### Runtime Type Checks\n\nThe `type` can be one of the following native constructors:\n\n- `String`\n- `Number`\n- `Boolean`\n- `Array`\n- `Object`\n- `Date`\n- `Function`\n- `Symbol`\n\nIn addition, `type` can also be a custom class or constructor function and the assertion will be made with an `instanceof` check. For example, given the following class:\n\n``` js\nclass Person {\n  constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n    this.firstName = firstName\n    this.lastName = lastName\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou could use it as a prop's type:\n\n``` js\ndefineProps({\n  author: Person\n})\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    author: Person\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVue will use `instanceof Person` to validate whether the value of the `author` prop is indeed an instance of the `Person` class.\n\n## Boolean Casting\n\nProps with `Boolean` type have special casting rules to mimic the behavior of native boolean attributes. Given a `<MyComponent>` with the following declaration:\n\n``` js\ndefineProps({\n  disabled: Boolean\n})\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    disabled: Boolean\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe component can be used like this:\n\n``` template\n<!-- equivalent of passing :disabled=\"true\" -->\n<MyComponent disabled />\n\n<!-- equivalent of passing :disabled=\"false\" -->\n<MyComponent />\n```\n\nWhen a prop is declared to allow multiple types, the casting rules for `Boolean` will also be applied. However, there is an edge when both `String` and `Boolean` are allowed - the Boolean casting rule only applies if Boolean appears before String:\n\n``` js\n// disabled will be casted to true\ndefineProps({\n  disabled: [Boolean, Number]\n})\n  \n// disabled will be casted to true\ndefineProps({\n  disabled: [Boolean, String]\n})\n  \n// disabled will be casted to true\ndefineProps({\n  disabled: [Number, Boolean]\n})\n  \n// disabled will be parsed as an empty string (disabled=\"\")\ndefineProps({\n  disabled: [String, Boolean]\n})\n```\n\n``` js\n// disabled will be casted to true\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    disabled: [Boolean, Number]\n  }\n}\n  \n// disabled will be casted to true\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    disabled: [Boolean, String]\n  }\n}\n  \n// disabled will be casted to true\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    disabled: [Number, Boolean]\n  }\n}\n  \n// disabled will be parsed as an empty string (disabled=\"\")\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    disabled: [String, Boolean]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props)"

  id: guide/components/events
  summary: This page assumes you've already read the Components Basics
  description: "# Component Events\n\n> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](../essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.\n\n## Emitting and Listening to Events\n\nA component can emit custom events directly in template expressions (e.g. in a `v-on` handler) using the built-in `$emit` method:\n\n``` template\n<!-- MyComponent -->\n<button @click=\"$emit('someEvent')\">click me</button>\n```\n\nThe `$emit()` method is also available on the component instance as `this.$emit()`:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    submit() {\n      this.$emit('someEvent')\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe parent can then listen to it using `v-on`:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent @some-event=\"callback\" />\n```\n\nThe `.once` modifier is also supported on component event listeners:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent @some-event.once=\"callback\" />\n```\n\nLike components and props, event names provide an automatic case transformation. Notice we emitted a camelCase event, but can listen for it using a kebab-cased listener in the parent. As with [props casing](props#prop-name-casing), we recommend using kebab-cased event listeners in templates.\n\n**TIP**\n\nUnlike native DOM events, component emitted events do **not** bubble. You can only listen to the events emitted by a direct child component. If there is a need to communicate between sibling or deeply nested components, use an external event bus or a [global state management solution](../scaling-up/state-management).\n\n## Event Arguments\n\nIt's sometimes useful to emit a specific value with an event. For example, we may want the `<BlogPost>` component to be in charge of how much to enlarge the text by. In those cases, we can pass extra arguments to `$emit` to provide this value:\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"$emit('increaseBy', 1)\">\n  Increase by 1\n</button>\n```\n\nThen, when we listen to the event in the parent, we can use an inline arrow function as the listener, which allows us to access the event argument:\n\n``` template\n<MyButton @increase-by=\"(n) => count += n\" />\n```\n\nOr, if the event handler is a method:\n\n``` template\n<MyButton @increase-by=\"increaseCount\" />\n```\n\nThen the value will be passed as the first parameter of that method:\n\n``` js\nmethods: {\n  increaseCount(n) {\n    this.count += n\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nfunction increaseCount(n) {\n  count.value += n\n}\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nAll extra arguments passed to `$emit()` after the event name will be forwarded to the listener. For example, with `$emit('foo', 1, 2, 3)` the listener function will receive three arguments.\n\n## Declaring Emitted Events\n\nA component can explicitly declare the events it will emit using the [`defineEmits()`](../../api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits) macro[`emits`](../../api/options-state#emits) option:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\ndefineEmits(['inFocus', 'submit'])\n</script>\n```\n\nThe `$emit` method that we used in the `<template>` isn't accessible within the `<script setup>` section of a component, but `defineEmits()` returns an equivalent function that we can use instead:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst emit = defineEmits(['inFocus', 'submit'])\n\nfunction buttonClick() {\n  emit('submit')\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nThe `defineEmits()` macro **cannot** be used inside a function, it must be placed directly within `<script setup>`, as in the example above.\n\nIf you're using an explicit `setup` function instead of `<script setup>`, events should be declared using the [`emits`](../../api/options-state#emits) option, and the `emit` function is exposed on the `setup()` context:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  emits: ['inFocus', 'submit'],\n  setup(props, ctx) {\n    ctx.emit('submit')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs with other properties of the `setup()` context, `emit` can safely be destructured:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  emits: ['inFocus', 'submit'],\n  setup(props, { emit }) {\n    emit('submit')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  emits: ['inFocus', 'submit']\n}\n```\n\nThe `emits` option and `defineEmits()` macro also support an object syntax. If using TypeScript you can type arguments, which allows us to perform runtime validation of the payload of the emitted events:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst emit = defineEmits({\n  submit(payload: { email: string, password: string }) {\n    // return `true` or `false` to indicate\n    // validation pass / fail\n  }\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nIf you are using TypeScript with `<script setup>`, it's also possible to declare emitted events using pure type annotations:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nconst emit = defineEmits<{\n  (e: 'change', id: number): void\n  (e: 'update', value: string): void\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\nMore details: [Typing Component Emits](../typescript/composition-api#typing-component-emits)\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  emits: {\n    submit(payload: { email: string, password: string }) {\n      // return `true` or `false` to indicate\n      // validation pass / fail\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSee also: [Typing Component Emits](../typescript/options-api#typing-component-emits)\n\nAlthough optional, it is recommended to define all emitted events in order to better document how a component should work. It also allows Vue to exclude known listeners from [fallthrough attributes](attrs#v-on-listener-inheritance), avoiding edge cases caused by DOM events manually dispatched by 3rd party code.\n\n**TIP**\n\nIf a native event (e.g., `click`) is defined in the `emits` option, the listener will now only listen to component-emitted `click` events and no longer respond to native `click` events.\n\n## Events Validation\n\nSimilar to prop type validation, an emitted event can be validated if it is defined with the object syntax instead of the array syntax.\n\nTo add validation, the event is assigned a function that receives the arguments passed to the `this.$emit``emit` call and returns a boolean to indicate whether the event is valid or not.\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst emit = defineEmits({\n  // No validation\n  click: null,\n\n  // Validate submit event\n  submit: ({ email, password }) => {\n    if (email && password) {\n      return true\n    } else {\n      console.warn('Invalid submit event payload!')\n      return false\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nfunction submitForm(email, password) {\n  emit('submit', { email, password })\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  emits: {\n    // No validation\n    click: null,\n\n    // Validate submit event\n    submit: ({ email, password }) => {\n      if (email && password) {\n        return true\n      } else {\n        console.warn('Invalid submit event payload!')\n        return false\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    submitForm(email, password) {\n      this.$emit('submit', { email, password })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events)"

  id: guide/components/v-model
  summary: v-model can be used on a component to implement a two-way binding
  description: "# Component v-model\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n`v-model` can be used on a component to implement a two-way binding.\n\nStarting in Vue 3.4, the recommended approach to achieve this is using the [`defineModel()`](../../api/sfc-script-setup#definemodel) macro:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- Child.vue -->\n<script setup>\nconst model = defineModel()\n\nfunction update() {\n  model.value++\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>parent bound v-model is: {{ model }}</div>\n</template>\n```\n\nThe parent can then bind a value with `v-model`:\n\n``` template\n<!-- Parent.vue -->\n<Child v-model=\"count\" />\n```\n\nThe value returned by `defineModel()` is a ref. It can be accessed and mutated like any other ref, except that it acts as a two-way binding between a parent value and a local one:\n\n- Its `.value` is synced with the value bound by the parent `v-model`;\n- When it is mutated by the child, it causes the parent bound value to be updated as well.\n\nThis means you can also bind this ref to a native input element with `v-model`, making it straightforward to wrap native input elements while providing the same `v-model` usage:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst model = defineModel()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input v-model=\"model\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n[Playground Example](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFUtFKwzAU/ZWYl06YLbK30Q10DFSYigq+5KW0t11mmoQknZPSf/cm3eqEsT0l555zuefmpKV3WsfbBuiUpjY3XDtiwTV6ziSvtTKOLNZcFKQ0qiZRnATkG6JB0BIDJen2kp5iMlfSOlLbisw8P4oeQAhFPpURxVV0zWSa9PNwEgIHtRaZA0SEpOvbeduG5q5LE0Sh2jvZ3tSqADFjFHlGSYJkmhz10zF1FseXvIo3VklcrfX9jOaq1lyAedGOoz1GpyQwnsvQ3fdTqDnTwPhQz9eQf52ob+zO1xh9NWDBbIHRgXOZqcD19PL9GXZ4H0h03whUnyHfwCrReI+97L6RBdo+0gW3j+H9uaw+7HLnQNrDUt6oV3ZBzyhmsjiz+p/dSTwJfUx2+IpD1ic+xz5enwQGXEDJJaw8Gl2I1upMzlc/hEvdOBR6SNKAjqP1J6P/o6XdL11L5h4=)\n\n### Under the Hood\n\n`defineModel` is a convenience macro. The compiler expands it to the following:\n\n- A prop named `modelValue`, which the local ref's value is synced with;\n- An event named `update:modelValue`, which is emitted when the local ref's value is mutated.\n\nThis is how you would implement the same child component shown above prior to 3.4:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst props = defineProps(['modelValue'])\nconst emit = defineEmits(['update:modelValue'])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input\n    :value=\"props.modelValue\"\n    @input=\"emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)\"\n  />\n</template>\n```\n\nAs you can see, it is quite a bit more verbose. However, it is helpful to understand what is happening under the hood.\n\nBecause `defineModel` declares a prop, you can therefore declare the underlying prop's options by passing it to `defineModel`:\n\n``` js\n// making the v-model required\nconst model = defineModel({ required: true })\n\n// providing a default value\nconst model = defineModel({ default: 0 })\n```\n\nFirst let's revisit how `v-model` is used on a native element:\n\n``` template\n<input v-model=\"searchText\" />\n```\n\nUnder the hood, the template compiler expands `v-model` to the more verbose equivalent for us. So the above code does the same as the following:\n\n``` template\n<input\n  :value=\"searchText\"\n  @input=\"searchText = $event.target.value\"\n/>\n```\n\nWhen used on a component, `v-model` instead expands to this:\n\n``` template\n<CustomInput\n  :model-value=\"searchText\"\n  @update:model-value=\"newValue => searchText = newValue\"\n/>\n```\n\nFor this to actually work though, the `<CustomInput>` component must do two things:\n\n1.  Bind the `value` attribute of a native `<input>` element to the `modelValue` prop\n2.  When a native `input` event is triggered, emit an `update:modelValue` custom event with the new value\n\nHere's that in action:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- CustomInput.vue -->\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: ['modelValue'],\n  emits: ['update:modelValue']\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input\n    :value=\"modelValue\"\n    @input=\"$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)\"\n  />\n</template>\n```\n\nNow `v-model` should work perfectly with this component:\n\n``` template\n<CustomInput v-model=\"searchText\" />\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFkctqwzAQRX9lEAEn4Np744aWrvoD3URdiHiSGvRCHpmC8b93JDfGKYGCkJjXvTrSJF69r8aIohHtcA69p6O0vfEuELzFgZx5tz4SXIIzUFT1JpfGCmmlxe/c3uFFRU0wSQtwdqxh0dLQwHSnNJep3ilS+8PSCxCQYrC3CMDgMKgrNlB8odaOXVJ2TgdvvNp6vSwHhMZrRcgRQLs1G5+M61A/S/ErKQXUR5immwXMWW1VEKX4g3j3Mo9QfXCeKU9FtvpQmp/lM0Oi6RP/qYieebHZNvyL0acLLODNmGYSxCogxVJ6yW1c2iWz/QOnEnY48kdUpMIVGSllD8t8zVZb+PkHqPG4iw==)\n\nAnother way of implementing `v-model` within this component is to use a writable `computed` property with both a getter and a setter. The `get` method should return the `modelValue` property and the `set` method should emit the corresponding event:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- CustomInput.vue -->\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: ['modelValue'],\n  emits: ['update:modelValue'],\n  computed: {\n    value: {\n      get() {\n        return this.modelValue\n      },\n      set(value) {\n        this.$emit('update:modelValue', value)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input v-model=\"value\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n## `v-model` arguments\n\n`v-model` on a component can also accept an argument:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent v-model:title=\"bookTitle\" />\n```\n\nIn the child component, we can support the corresponding argument by passing a string to `defineModel()` as its first argument:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- MyComponent.vue -->\n<script setup>\nconst title = defineModel('title')\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" v-model=\"title\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the

prop options are also needed, they should be passed after the model name:\n\n``` js\nconst title = defineModel('title', { required: true })\n```\n\nPre 3.4 Usage\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- MyComponent.vue -->\n<script setup>\ndefineProps(['title'])\ndefineEmits(['update:title'])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input\n    type=\"text\"\n    :value=\"title\"\n

this case, instead of the default `modelValue` prop and `update:modelValue` event, the child component should expect a `title` prop and emit an `update:title` event to update the parent value:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- MyComponent.vue -->\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: ['title'],\n  emits: ['update:title']\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input\n    type=\"text\"\n    :value=\"title\"\n

Multiple `v-model` bindings\n\nBy leveraging the ability to target a particular prop and event as we learned before with [`v-model` arguments](#v-model-arguments), we can now create multiple `v-model` bindings on a single component instance.\n\nEach `v-model` will sync to a different prop, without the need for extra options in the component:\n\n``` template\n<UserName\n  v-model:first-name=\"first\"\n  v-model:last-name=\"last\"\n/>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst firstName = defineModel('firstName')\nconst lastName =

Handling `v-model` modifiers\n\nWhen we were learning about form input bindings, we saw that `v-model` has [built-in modifiers](../essentials/forms#modifiers) - `.trim`, `.number` and `.lazy`. In some cases, you might also want the `v-model` on your custom input component to support custom modifiers.\n\nLet's create an example custom modifier, `capitalize`, that capitalizes the first letter of the string provided by the `v-model` binding:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent v-model.capitalize=\"myText\" />\n```\n\nModifiers added to a component `v-model` can be accessed in the child component by destructuring the `defineModel()` return value like this:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst [model, modifiers] = defineModel()\n\nconsole.log(modifiers) // { capitalize: true }\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" v-model=\"model\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nTo conditionally adjust how the value should be read / written based on modifiers, we can pass `get` and `set` options to `defineModel()`. These two options receive the value on get / set of the model ref and should return a transformed value. This is how we can use the `set` option to implement the `capitalize` modifier:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst [model, modifiers] = defineModel({\n  set(value) {\n    if (modifiers.capitalize) {\n      return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)\n    }\n    return value\n  }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" v-model=\"model\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\nPre 3.4 Usage\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst props = defineProps({\n  modelValue: String,\n  modelModifiers: { default: () => ({}) }\n})\n\nconst emit = defineEmits(['update:modelValue'])\n\nfunction emitValue(e) {\n  let value = e.target.value\n  if (props.modelModifiers.capitalize) {\n    value = value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)\n  }\n  emit('update:modelValue', value)\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" :value=\"modelValue\" @input=\"emitValue\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\nModifiers added to a component `v-model` will be provided to the component via the `modelModifiers` prop. In the below example, we have created a component that contains a `modelModifiers` prop that defaults to an empty object:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    modelValue: String,\n    modelModifiers: {\n      default: () => ({})\n    }\n  },\n  emits: ['update:modelValue'],\n  created() {\n    console.log(this.modelModifiers) // { capitalize: true }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input\n    type=\"text\"\n    :value=\"modelValue\"\n    @input=\"$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)\"\n  />\n</template>\n```\n\nNotice the component's `modelModifiers` prop contains `capitalize` and its value is `true` - due to it being set on the `v-model` binding `v-model.capitalize=\"myText\"`.\n\nNow that we have our prop set up, we can check the `modelModifiers` object keys and write a handler to change the emitted value. In the code below we will capitalize the string whenever the `<input />` element fires an `input` event.\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    modelValue: String,\n    modelModifiers: {\n      default: () => ({})\n    }\n  },\n  emits: ['update:modelValue'],\n  methods: {\n    emitValue(e) {\n      let value = e.target.value\n      if (this.modelModifiers.capitalize) {\n        value = value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)\n      }\n      this.$emit('update:modelValue', value)\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" :value=\"modelValue\" @input=\"emitValue\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n### Modifiers for `v-model` with arguments\n\nFor `v-model` bindings with both argument and modifiers, the generated prop name will be `arg + \"Modifiers\"`. For example:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent v-model:title.capitalize=\"myText\">\n```\n\nThe corresponding declarations should be:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['title', 'titleModifiers'],\n  emits: ['update:title'],\n  created() {\n    console.log(this.titleModifiers) // { capitalize: true }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere's another example of using modifiers with multiple `v-model` with different arguments:\n\n``` template\n<UserName\n  v-model:first-name.capitalize=\"first\"\n  v-model:last-name.uppercase=\"last\"\n/>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst [firstName, firstNameModifiers] = defineModel('firstName')\nconst [lastName, lastNameModifiers] = defineModel('lastName')\n\nconsole.log(firstNameModifiers) // { capitalize: true }\nconsole.log(lastNameModifiers) // { uppercase: true}\n</script>\n```\n\nPre 3.4 Usage\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst props = defineProps({\nfirstName: String,\nlastName: String,\nfirstNameModifiers: { default: () => ({}) },\nlastNameModifiers: { default: () => ({}) }\n})\ndefineEmits(['update:firstName', 'update:lastName'])\n\nconsole.log(props.firstNameModifiers) // { capitalize: true }\nconsole.log(props.lastNameModifiers) // { uppercase: true}\n</script>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    firstName: String,\n    lastName: String,\n    firstNameModifiers: {\n      default: () => ({})\n    },\n    lastNameModifiers: {\n      default: () => ({})\n    }\n  },\n  emits: ['update:firstName', 'update:lastName'],\n  created() {\n    console.log(this.firstNameModifiers) // { capitalize: true }\n    console.log(this.lastNameModifiers) // { uppercase: true}\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model)"

  id: guide/components/attrs
  summary: This page assumes you've already read the Components Basics
  description: "# Fallthrough Attributes\n\n> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](../essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.\n\n## Attribute Inheritance\n\nA \"fallthrough attribute\" is an attribute or `v-on` event listener that is passed to a component, but is not explicitly declared in the receiving component's [props](props) or [emits](events#declaring-emitted-events). Common examples of this include `class`, `style`, and `id` attributes.\n\nWhen a component renders a single root element, fallthrough attributes will be automatically added to the root element's attributes. For example, given a `<MyButton>` component with the following template:\n\n``` template\n<!-- template of <MyButton> -->\n<button>click me</button>\n```\n\nAnd a parent using this component with:\n\n``` template\n<MyButton class=\"large\" />\n```\n\nThe final rendered DOM would be:\n\n``` html\n<button class=\"large\">click me</button>\n```\n\nHere, `<MyButton>` did not declare `class` as an accepted prop. Therefore, `class` is treated as a fallthrough attribute and automatically added to `<MyButton>`'s root element.\n\n### `class` and `style` Merging\n\nIf the child component's root element already has existing `class` or `style` attributes, it will be merged with the `class` and `style` values that are inherited from the parent. Suppose we change the template of `<MyButton>` in the previous example to:\n\n``` template\n<!-- template of <MyButton> -->\n<button class=\"btn\">click me</button>\n```\n\nThen the final rendered DOM would now become:\n\n``` html\n<button class=\"btn large\">click me</button>\n```\n\n### `v-on` Listener Inheritance\n\nThe same rule applies to `v-on` event listeners:\n\n``` template\n<MyButton @click=\"onClick\" />\n```\n\nThe `click` listener will be added to the root element of `<MyButton>`, i.e. the native `<button>` element. When the native `<button>` is clicked, it will trigger the `onClick` method of the parent component. If the native `<button>` already has a `click` listener bound with `v-on`, then both listeners will trigger.\n\n### Nested Component Inheritance\n\nIf a component renders another component as its root node, for example, we refactored `<MyButton>` to render a `<BaseButton>` as its root:\n\n``` template\n<!-- template of <MyButton/> that simply renders another component -->\n<BaseButton />\n```\n\nThen the fallthrough attributes received by `<MyButton>` will be automatically forwarded to `<BaseButton>`.\n\nNote that:\n\n1.  Forwarded attributes do not include any attributes that are declared as props, or `v-on` listeners of declared events by `<MyButton>` - in other words, the declared props and listeners have been \"consumed\" by `<MyButton>`.\n\n2.  Forwarded attributes may be accepted as props by `<BaseButton>`, if declared by it.\n\n## Disabling Attribute Inheritance\n\nIf you do **not** want a component to automatically inherit attributes, you can set `inheritAttrs: false` in the component's options.\n\nSince 3.3 you can also use [`defineOptions`](../../api/sfc-script-setup#defineoptions) directly in `<script setup>`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\ndefineOptions({\n  inheritAttrs: false\n})\n// ...setup logic\n</script>\n```\n\nThe common scenario for disabling attribute inheritance is when attributes need to be applied to other elements besides the root node. By setting the `inheritAttrs` option to `false`, you can take full control over where the fallthrough attributes should be applied.\n\nThese fallthrough attributes can be accessed directly in template expressions as `$attrs`:\n\n``` template\n<span>Fallthrough attributes: {{ $attrs }}</span>\n```\n\nThe `$attrs` object includes all attributes that are not declared by the component's `props` or `emits` options (e.g., `class`, `style`, `v-on` listeners, etc.).\n\nSome notes:\n\n- Unlike props, fallthrough attributes preserve their original casing in JavaScript, so an attribute like `foo-bar` needs to be accessed as `$attrs['foo-bar']`.\n\n- A `v-on` event listener like `@click` will be exposed on the object as a function under `$attrs.onClick`.\n\nUsing our `<MyButton>` component example from the [previous section](#attribute-inheritance) - sometimes we may need to wrap the actual `<button>` element with an extra `<div>` for styling purposes:\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"btn-wrapper\">\n  <button class=\"btn\">click me</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nWe want all fallthrough attributes like `class` and `v-on` listeners to be applied to the inner `<button>`, not the outer `<div>`. We can achieve this with `inheritAttrs: false` and `v-bind=\"$attrs\"`:\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"btn-wrapper\">\n  <button class=\"btn\" v-bind=\"$attrs\">click me</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nRemember that [`v-bind` without an argument](../essentials/template-syntax#dynamically-binding-multiple-attributes) binds all the properties of an object as attributes of the target element.\n\n## Attribute Inheritance on Multiple Root Nodes\n\nUnlike components with a single root node, components with multiple root nodes do not have an automatic attribute fallthrough behavior. If `$attrs` are not bound explicitly, a runtime warning will be issued.\n\n``` template\n<CustomLayout id=\"custom-layout\" @click=\"changeValue\" />\n```\n\nIf `<CustomLayout>` has the following multi-root template, there will be a warning because Vue cannot be sure where to apply the fallthrough attributes:\n\n``` template\n<header>...</header>\n<main>...</main>\n<footer>...</footer>\n```\n\nThe warning will be suppressed if `$attrs` is explicitly bound:\n\n``` template\n<header>...</header>\n<main v-bind=\"$attrs\">...</main>\n<footer>...</footer>\n```\n\n## Accessing Fallthrough Attributes in JavaScript\n\nIf needed, you can access a component's fallthrough attributes in `<script setup>` using the `useAttrs()` API:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { useAttrs } from 'vue'\n\nconst attrs = useAttrs()\n</script>\n```\n\nIf not using `<script setup>`, `attrs` will be exposed as a property of the `setup()` context:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  setup(props, ctx) {\n    // fallthrough attributes are exposed as ctx.attrs\n    console.log(ctx.attrs)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that although the `attrs` object here always reflects the latest fallthrough attributes, it isn't reactive (for performance reasons). You cannot use watchers to observe its changes. If you need reactivity, use a prop. Alternatively, you can use `onUpdated()` to perform side effects with the latest `attrs` on each update.\n\nIf needed, you can access a component's fallthrough attributes via the `$attrs` instance property:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  created() {\n    console.log(this.$attrs)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs)"

  summary: This page assumes you've already read the Components Basics
  description: "# Slots\n\n> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](../essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.\n\n## Slot Content and Outlet\n\nWe have learned that components can accept props, which can be JavaScript values of any type. But how about template content? In some cases, we may want to pass a template fragment to a child component, and let the child component render the fragment within its own template.\n\nFor example, we may have a `<FancyButton>` component that supports usage like this:\n\n``` template\n<FancyButton>\n  Click me! <!-- slot content -->\n</FancyButton>\n```\n\nThe template of `<FancyButton>` looks like this:\n\n``` template\n<button class=\"fancy-btn\">\n  <slot></slot> <!-- slot outlet -->\n</button>\n```\n\nThe `<slot>` element is a **slot outlet** that indicates where the parent-provided **slot content** should be rendered.\n\nAnd the final rendered DOM:\n\n``` html\n<button class=\"fancy-btn\">Click me!</button>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpdUdlqAyEU/ZVbQ0kLMdNsXabTQFvoV8yLcRkkjopLSQj596oTwqRvnuM9y9UT+rR2/hs5qlHjqZM2gOch2m2rZW+NC/BDND1+xRCMBuFMD9N5NeKyeNrqphrUSZdA4L1VJPCEAJrRdCEAvpWke+g5NHcYg1cmADU6cB0A4zzThmYckqimupqiGfpXILe/zdwNhaki3n+0SOR5vAu6ReU++efUajtqYGJQ/FIg5w8Wt9FlOx+OKh/nV1c4ZVNqlHE1TIQQ7xnvCN13zkTNalBSc+Jw5wiTac2H1WLDeDeDyXrJVm9LWG7uE3hev3AhHge1cYwnO200L4QljEnd1bCxB1g82UNhe+I6qQs5kuGcE30NrxeaRudzOWtkemeXuHP5tLIKOv8BN+mw3w==)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpdUdtOwzAM/RUThAbSurIbl1ImARJf0ZesSapoqROlKdo07d9x0jF1SHmIT+xzcY7sw7nZTy9Zwcqu9tqFTYW6ddYH+OZYHz77ECyC8raFySwfYXFsUiFAhXKfBoRUvDcBjhGtLbGgxNAVcLziOlVIp8wvelQE2TrDg6QKoBx1JwDgy+h6B62E8ibLoDM2kAAGoocsiz1VKMfmCCrzCymbsn/GY95rze1grja8694rpmJ/tg1YsfRO/FE134wc2D4YeTYQ9QeKa+mUrgsHE6+zC+vfjoz1Bdwqpd5iveX1rvG2R1GA0Si5zxrPhaaY98v5WshmCrerhVi+LmCxvqPiafUslXoYpq0XkuiQ1p4Ax4XQ2BSwdnuYP7p9QlvuG40JHI1lUaenv3o5w3Xvu2jOWU179oQNn5aisNMvLBvDOg==)\n\nWith slots, the `<FancyButton>` is responsible for rendering the outer `<button>` (and its fancy styling), while the inner content is provided by the parent component.\n\nAnother way to understand slots is by comparing them to JavaScript functions:\n\n``` js\n// parent component passing slot content\nFancyButton('Click me!')\n\n// FancyButton renders slot content in its own template\nfunction FancyButton(slotContent) {\n  return `<button class=\"fancy-btn\">\n      ${slotContent}\n    </button>`\n}\n```\n\nSlot content is not just limited to text. It can be any valid template content. For example, we can pass in multiple elements, or even other components:\n\n``` template\n<FancyButton>\n  <span style=\"color:red\">Click me!</span>\n  <AwesomeIcon name=\"plus\" />\n</FancyButton>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNptUltu2zAQvMpGQZEWsOzGiftQ1QBpgQK9g35oaikwkUiCj9aGkTPkBPnLIXKeXCBXyJKKBdoIoA/tYGd3doa74tqY+b+ARVXUjltp/FWj5GC09fCHKb79FbzXCoTVA5zNFxkWaWdT8/V/dHrAvzxrzrC3ZoBG4SYRWhQs9B52EeWapihU3lWwyxfPDgbfNYq+ejEppcLjYHrmkSqAOqMmAOB3L/ktDEhV4+v8gMR/l1M7wxQ4v+3xZ1Nw3Wtb8S1TTXG1H3cCJIO69oxc5mLUcrSrXkxSi1lxZGT0//CS9Wg875lzJELE/nLto4bko69dr31cFc8auw+3JHvSEfQ7nwbsHY9HwakQ4kes14zfdlYH1VbQS4XMlp1lraRMPl6cr1rsZnB6uWwvvi9hufpAxZfLryjEp5GtbYs0TlGICTCsbaXqKliZDZx/NpuEDsx2UiUwo5VxT6Dkv73BPFgXxRktlUdL2Jh6OoW8O3pX0buTsoTgaCNQcDjoGwk3wXkQ2tJLGzSYYI126KAso0uTSc8Pjy9P93k2d6+NyRKa)\n\nBy using slots, our `<FancyButton>` is more flexible and reusable. We can now use it in different places with different inner content, but all with the same fancy styling.\n\nVue components' slot mechanism is inspired by the [native Web Component `<slot>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot), but with additional capabilities that we will see later.\n\n## Render Scope\n\nSlot content has access to the data scope of the parent component, because it is defined in the parent. For example:\n\n``` template\n<span>{{ message }}</span>\n<FancyButton>{{ message }}</FancyButton>\n```\n\nHere both `{{ message }}` interpolations will render the same content.\n\nSlot content does **not** have access to the child component's data. Expressions in Vue templates can only access the scope it is defined in, consistent with JavaScript's lexical scoping. In other words:\n\n> Expressions in the parent template only have access to the parent scope; expressions in the child template only have access to the child scope.\n\n## Fallback Content\n\nThere are cases when it's useful to specify fallback (i.e. default) content for a slot, to be rendered only when no content is provided. For example, in a `<SubmitButton>` component:\n\n``` template\n<button type=\"submit\">\n  <slot></slot>\n</button>\n```\n\nWe might want the text \"Submit\" to be rendered inside the `<button>` if the parent didn't provide any slot content. To make \"Submit\" the fallback content, we can place it in between the `<slot>` tags:\n\n``` template\n<button type=\"submit\">\n  <slot>\n    Submit <!-- fallback content -->\n  </slot>\n</button>\n```\n\nNow when we use `<SubmitButton>` in a parent component, providing no content for the slot:\n\n``` template\n<SubmitButton />\n```\n\nThis will render the fallback content, \"Submit\":\n\n``` html\n<button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n```\n\nBut if we provide content:\n\n``` template\n<SubmitButton>Save</SubmitButton>\n```\n\nThen the provided content will be rendered instead:\n\n``` html\n<button type=\"submit\">Save</button>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp1kMsKwjAQRX9lzMaNbfcSC/oL3WbT1ikU8yKZFEX8d5MGgi2YVeZxZ86dN7taWy8B2ZlxP7rZEnikYFuhZ2WNI+jCoGa6BSKjYXJGwbFufpNJfhSaN1kflTEgVFb2hDEC4IeqguARpl7KoR8fQPgkqKpc3Wxo1lxRWWeW+Y4wBk9x9V9d2/UL8g1XbOJN4WAntodOnrecQ2agl8WLYH7tFyw5olj10iR3EJ+gPCxDFluj0YS6EAqKR8mi9M3Td1ifLxWShcU=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp1UEEOwiAQ/MrKxYu1d4Mm+gWvXChuk0YKpCyNxvh3lxIb28SEA8zuDDPzEucQ9mNCcRAymqELdFKu64MfCK6p6Tu6JCLvoB18D9t9/Qtm4lY5AOXwMVFu2OpkCV4ZNZ51HDqKhwLAQjIjb+X4yHr+mh+EfbCakF8AclNVkCJCq61ttLkD4YOgqsp0YbGesJkVBj92NwSTIrH3v7zTVY8oF8F4SdazD7ET69S5rqXPpnigZ8CjEnHaVyInIp5G63O6XIGiIlZMzrGMd8RVfR0q4lIKKV+L+srW+wNTTZq3)\n\n## Named Slots\n\nThere are times when it's useful to have multiple slot outlets in a single component. For example, in a `<BaseLayout>` component with the following template:\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <header>\n    <!-- We want header content here -->\n  </header>\n  <main>\n    <!-- We want main content here -->\n  </main>\n  <footer>\n    <!-- We want footer content here -->\n  </footer>\n</div>\n```\n\nFor these cases, the `<slot>` element has a special attribute, `name`, which can be used to assign a unique ID to different slots so you can determine where content should be rendered:\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <header>\n    <slot name=\"header\"></slot>\n  </header>\n  <main>\n    <slot></slot>\n  </main>\n  <footer>\n    <slot name=\"footer\"></slot>\n  </footer>\n</div>\n```\n\nA `<slot>` outlet without `name` implicitly has the name \"default\".\n\nIn a parent component using `<BaseLayout>`, we need a way to pass multiple slot content fragments, each targeting a different slot outlet. This is where **named slots** come in.\n\nTo pass a named slot, we need to use a `<template>` element with the `v-slot` directive, and then pass the name of the slot as an argument to `v-slot`:\n\n``` template\n<BaseLayout>\n  <template v-slot:header>\n    <!-- content for the header slot -->\n  </template>\n</BaseLayout>\n```\n\n`v-slot` has a dedicated shorthand `#`, so `<template v-slot:header>` can be shortened to just `<template #header>`. Think of it as \"render this template fragment in the child component's 'header' slot\".\n\nHere's the code passing content for all three slots to `<BaseLayout>` using the shorthand syntax:\n\n``` template\n<BaseLayout>\n  <template #header>\n    <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>\n  </template>\n\n  <template #default>\n    <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>\n    <p>And another one.</p>\n  </template>\n\n  <template #footer>\n    <p>Here's some contact info</p>\n  </template>\n</BaseLayout>\n```\n\nWhen a component accepts both a default slot and named slots, all top-level non-`<template>` nodes are implicitly treated as content for the default slot. So the above can also be written as:\n\n``` template\n<BaseLayout>\n  <template #header>\n    <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>\n  </template>\n\n  <!-- implicit default slot -->\n  <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>\n  <p>And another one.</p>\n\n  <template #footer>\n    <p>Here's some contact info</p>\n  </template>\n</BaseLayout>\n```\n\nNow everything inside the `<template>` elements will be passed to the corresponding slots. The final rendered HTML will be:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <header>\n    <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>\n  </header>\n  <main>\n    <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>\n    <p>And another one.</p>\n  </main>\n  <footer>\n    <p>Here's some contact info</p>\n  </footer>\n</div>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9UsFuwjAM/RWrHLgMOi5o6jIkdtphn9BLSF0aKU2ixEVjiH+fm8JoQdvRfu/5xS8+ZVvvl4cOsyITUQXtCSJS5zel1a13geBdRvyUR9cR1MG1MF/mt1YvnZdW5IOWVVwQtt5IQq4AxI2cau5ccZg1KCsMlz4jzWrzgQGh1fuGYIcgwcs9AmkyKHKGLyPykcfD1Apr2ZmrHUN+s+U5Qe6D9A3ULgA1bCK1BeUsoaWlyPuVb3xbgbSOaQGcxRH8v3XtHI0X8mmfeYToWkxmUhFoW7s/JvblJLERmj1l0+T7T5tqK30AZWSMb2WW3LTFUGZXp/u8o3EEVrbI9AFjLn8mt38fN9GIPrSp/p4/Yoj7OMZ+A/boN9KInPeZZpAOLNLRDAsPZDgN4p0L/NQFOV/Ayn9x6EZXMFNKvQ4E5YwLBczW6/WlU3NIi6i/sYDn5Qu2qX1OF51MsvMPkrIEHg==)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9UkFuwjAQ/MoqHLiUpFxQlaZI9NRDn5CLSTbEkmNb9oKgiL934wRwQK3ky87O7njGPicba9PDHpM8KXzlpKV1qWVnjSP4FB6/xcnsCRpnOpin2R3qh+alBig1HgO9xkbsFcG5RyvDOzRq8vkAQLSury+l5lNkN1EuCDurBCFXAMWdH2pGrn2YtShqdCPOnXa5/kKH0MldS7BFEGDFDoEkKSwybo8rskjjaevo4L7Wrje8x4mdE7aFxjiglkWE1GxQE9tLi8xO+LoGoQ3THLD/qP2/dGMMxYZs8DP34E2HQUxUBFI35o+NfTlJLOomL8n04frXns7W8gCVEt5/lElQkxpdmVyVHvP2yhBo0SHThx5z+TEZvl1uMlP0oU3nH/kRo3iMI9Ybes960UyRsZ9pBuGDeTqpwfBAvn7NrXF81QUZm8PSHjl0JWuYVVX1PhAqo4zLYbZarUak4ZAWXv5gDq/pG3YBHn50EEkuv5irGBk=)\n\nAgain, it may help you understand named slots better using the JavaScript function analogy:\n\n``` js\n// passing multiple slot fragments with different names\nBaseLayout({\n  header: `...`,\n  default: `...`,\n  footer: `...`\n})\n\n// <BaseLayout> renders them in different places\nfunction BaseLayout(slots) {\n  return `<div class=\"container\">\n      <header>${slots.header}</header>\n      <main>${slots.default}</main>\n      <footer>${slots.footer}</footer>\n    </div>`\n}\n```\n\n## Dynamic Slot Names\n\n[Dynamic directive arguments](../essentials/template-syntax#dynamic-arguments) also work on `v-slot`, allowing the definition of dynamic slot names:\n\n``` template\n<base-layout>\n  <template v-slot:[dynamicSlotName]>\n    ...\n  </template>\n\n  <!-- with shorthand -->\n  <template #[dynamicSlotName]>\n    ...\n  </template>\n</base-layout>\n```\n\nDo note the expression is subject to the [syntax constraints](../essentials/template-syntax#directives) of dynamic directive arguments.\n\n## Scoped Slots\n\nAs discussed in [Render Scope](#render-scope), slot content does not have access to state in the child component.\n\nHowever, there are cases where it could be useful if a slot's content can make use of data from both the parent scope and the child scope. To achieve that, we need a way for the child to pass data to a slot when rendering it.\n\nIn fact, we can do exactly that - we can pass attributes to a slot outlet just like passing props to a component:\n\n``` template\n<!-- <MyComponent> template -->\n<div>\n  <slot :text=\"greetingMessage\" :count=\"1\"></slot>\n</div>\n```\n\nReceiving the slot props is a bit different when using a single default slot vs. using named slots. We are going to show how to receive props using a single default slot first, by using `v-slot` directly on the child component tag:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent v-slot=\"slotProps\">\n  {{ slotProps.text }} {{ slotProps.count }}\n</MyComponent>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9kMEKgzAMhl8l9OJlU3aVOhg7C3uAXsRlTtC2tFE2pO++dA5xMnZqk+b/8/2dxMnadBxQ5EL62rWWwCMN9qh021vjCMrn2fBNoya4OdNDkmarXhQnSstsVrOOC8LedhVhrEiuHca97wwVSsTj4oz1SvAUgKJpgqWZEj4IQoCvZm0Gtgghzss1BDvIbFkqdmID+CNdbbQnaBwitbop0fuqQSgguWPXmX+JePe1HT/QMtJBHnE51MZOCcjfzPx04JxsydPzp2Szxxo7vABY1I/p)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFkNFqxCAQRX9l8CUttAl9DbZQ+rzQD/AlJLNpwKjoJGwJ/nvHpAnusrAg6FzHO567iE/nynlCUQsZWj84+lBmGJ31BKffL8sng4bg7O0IRVllWnpWKAOgDF7WBx2em0kTLElt975QbwLkhkmIyvCS1TGXC8LR6YYwVSTzH8yvQVt6VyJt3966oAR38XhaFjjEkvBCECNcia2d2CLyOACZQ7CDrI6h4kXcAF7lcg+za6h5et4JPdLkzV4B9B6RBtOfMISmxxqKH9TarrGtATxMgf/bDfM/qExEUCdEDuLGXAmoV06+euNs2JK7tyCrzSNHjX9aurQf)\n\nThe props passed to the slot by the child are available as the value of the corresponding `v-slot` directive, which can be accessed by expressions inside the slot.\n\nYou can think of a scoped slot as a function being passed into the child component. The child component then calls it, passing props as arguments:\n\n``` js\nMyComponent({\n  // passing the default slot, but as a function\n  default: (slotProps) => {\n    return `${slotProps.text} ${slotProps.count}`\n  }\n})\n\nfunction MyComponent(slots) {\n  const greetingMessage = 'hello'\n  return `<div>${\n    // call the slot function with props!\n    slots.default({ text: greetingMessage, count: 1 })\n  }</div>`\n}\n```\n\nIn fact, this is very close to how scoped slots are compiled, and how you would use scoped slots in manual [render functions](../extras/render-function).\n\nNotice how `v-slot=\"slotProps\"` matches the slot function signature. Just like with function arguments, we can use destructuring in `v-slot`:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent v-slot=\"{ text, count }\">\n  {{ text }} {{ count }}\n</MyComponent>\n```\n\n### Named Scoped Slots\n\nNamed scoped slots work similarly - slot props are accessible as the value of the `v-slot` directive: `v-slot:name=\"slotProps\"`. When using the shorthand, it looks like this:\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent>\n  <template #header=\"headerProps\">\n    {{ headerProps }}\n  </template>\n\n  <template #default=\"defaultProps\">\n    {{ defaultProps }}\n  </template>\n\n  <template #footer=\"footerProps\">\n    {{ footerProps }}\n  </template>\n</MyComponent>\n```\n\nPassing props to a named slot:\n\n``` template\n<slot name=\"header\" message=\"hello\"></slot>\n```\n\nNote the `name` of a slot won't be included in the props because it is reserved - so the resulting `headerProps` would be `{ message: 'hello' }`.\n\nIf you are mixing named slots with the default scoped slot, you need to use an explicit `<template>` tag for the default slot. Attempting to place the `v-slot` directive directly on the component will result in a compilation error. This is to avoid any ambiguity about the scope of the props of the default slot. For example:\n\n``` template\n<!-- This template won't compile -->\n<template>\n  <MyComponent v-slot=\"{ message }\">\n    <p>{{ message }}</p>\n    <template #footer>\n      <!-- message belongs to the default slot, and is not available here -->\n      <p>{{ message }}</p>\n    </template>\n  </MyComponent>\n</template>\n```\n\nUsing an explicit `<template>` tag for the default slot helps to make it clear that the `message` prop is not available inside the other slot:\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <MyComponent>\n    <!-- Use explicit default slot -->\n    <template #default=\"{ message }\">\n      <p>{{ message }}</p>\n    </template>\n\n    <template #footer>\n      <p>Here's some contact info</p>\n    </template>\n  </MyComponent>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Fancy List Example\n\nYou may be wondering what would be a good use case for scoped slots. Here's an example: imagine a `<FancyList>` component that renders a list of items - it may encapsulate the logic for loading remote data, using the data to display a list, or even advanced features like pagination or infinite scrolling. However, we want it to be flexible with how each item looks and leave the styling of each item to the parent component consuming it. So the desired usage may look like this:\n\n``` template\n<FancyList :api-url=\"url\" :per-page=\"10\">\n  <template #item=\"{ body, username, likes }\">\n    <div class=\"item\">\n      <p>{{ body }}</p>\n      <p>by {{ username }} | {{ likes }} likes</p>\n    </div>\n  </template>\n</FancyList>\n```\n\nInside `<FancyList>`, we can render the same `<slot>` multiple times with different item data (notice we are using `v-bind` to pass an object as slot props):\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li v-for=\"item in items\">\n    <slot name=\"item\" v-bind=\"item\"></slot>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFU2Fv0zAQ/StHJtROapNuZTBCNwnQQKBpTGxCQss+uMml8+bYlu2UlZL/zjlp0lQa40sU3/nd3Xv3vA7eax0uSwziYGZTw7UDi67Up4nkhVbGwScm09U5tw5yowoYhFEX8cBBImdRgyQMHRwWWjCHdAKYbdFM83FpxEkS0DcJINZoxpotkCIHkySo7xOixcMep19KrmGustUISotGsgJHIPgDWqg6DKEyvoRUMGsJ4HG9HGX16bqpAlU1izy5baqDFegYweYroMttMwLAHx/Y9Kyan36RWUTN2+mjXfpbrei8k6SjdSuBYFOlMaNI6AeAtcflSrqx5b8xhkl4jMU7H0yVUCaGvVeH8+PjKYWqWnpf5DQYBTtb+fc612Awh2qzzGaBiUyVpBVpo7SFE8gw5xIv/Wl4M9gsbjCCQbuywe3+FuXl9iiqO7xpElEEhUofKFQo2mTGiFiOLr3jcpFImuiaF6hKNxzuw8lpw7kuEy6ZKJGK3TR6NluLYXBVqwRXQjkLn0ueIc3TLonyZ0sm4acqKVovKIbDCVQjGsb1qvyg2telU4Yzz6eHv6ARBWdwjVqUNCbbFjqgQn6aW1J8RKfJhDg+5/lStG4QHJZjnpO5XjT0BMqFu+uZ81yxjEQJw7A1kOA76FyZjaWBy0akvu8tCQKeQ+d7wsy5zLpz1FlzU3kW1QP+x40ApWgWAySEJTv6/NitNMkllcTakwCaZZ5ADEf6cROas/RhYVQps5igEpkZLwzRROmG04OjDBcj7+Js+vYQDo9e0uH1qzeY5/s1vtaaqG969+vTTrsmBTMLLv12nuy7l+d5W673SBzxkzlfhPdWSXokdZMkSFWhuUDzTTtOnk6CuG2fBEwI9etrHXOmRLJUE0/vMH14In5vH30sCS4Nkr+WmARdztHQ6Jr02dUFPtJ/lyxUVgq6/UzyO1olSj9jc+0DcaWxe/fqab/UT51Uu7Znjw6lbUn5QWtR6vtJQM//4zPUt+NOw+lGzCqo/gLm1QS8)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n### Renderless Components\n\nThe `<FancyList>` use case we discussed above encapsulates both reusable logic (data fetching, pagination etc.) and visual output, while delegating part of the visual output to the consumer component via scoped slots.\n\nIf we push this concept a bit further, we can come up with components that only encapsulate logic and do not render anything by themselves - visual output is fully delegated to the consumer component with scoped slots. We call this type of component a **Renderless Component**.\n\nAn example renderless component could be one that encapsulates the logic of tracking the current mouse position:\n\n``` template\n<MouseTracker v-slot=\"{ x, y }\">\n  Mouse is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}\n</MouseTracker>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNUcFqhDAQ/ZUhF12w2rO4Cz301t5aaCEX0dki1SQko6uI/96J7i4qLPQQmHmZ9+Y9ZhQvxsRdiyIVmStsZQgcUmtOUlWN0ZbgXbcOP2xe/KKFs9UNBHGyBj09kCpLFj4zuSFsTJ0T+o6yjUb35GpNRylG6CMYYJKCpwAkzWNQOcgphZG/YZoiX/DQNAttFjMrS+6LRCT2rh6HGsHiOQKtmKIIS19+qmZpYLrmXIKxM1Vo5Yj9HD0vfD7ckGGF3LDWlOyHP/idYPQCfdzldTtjscl/8MuDww78lsqHVHdTYXjwCpdKlfoS52X52qGit8oRKrRhwHYdNrrDILouPbCNVZCtgJ1n/6Xx8JYAmT8epD3fr5cC0oGLQYpkd4zpD27R0vA=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqVUU1rwzAM/SvCl7SQJTuHdLDDbttthw18MbW6hjW2seU0oeS/T0lounQfUDBGepaenvxO4tG5rIkoClGGra8cPUhT1c56ghcbA756tf1EDztva0iy/Ds4NCbSAEiD7diicafigeA0oFvLPAYNhWICYEE5IL00fMp8Hs0JYe0OinDIqFyIaO7CwdJGihO0KXTcLriK59NYBlUARTyMn6Hv0yHgIp7ARAvl3FXm8yCRiuu1Fv/x23JakVqtz3t5pOjNOQNoC7hPz0nHyRSzEr7Ghxppb/XlZ6JjRlzhTAlA+ypkLWwAM6c+8G2BdzP+/pPbRkOoL/KOldH2mCmtnxr247kKhAb9KuHKgLVtMEkn2knG+sIVzV9sfmy8hfB/swHKwV0oWja4lQKKjoNOivzKrf4L/JPqaQ==)\n\nWhile an interesting pattern, most of what can be achieved with Renderless Components can be achieved in a more efficient fashion with Composition API, without incurring the overhead of extra component nesting. Later, we will see how we can implement the same mouse tracking functionality as a [Composable](../reusability/composables).\n\nThat said, scoped slots are still useful in cases where we need to both encapsulate logic **and** compose visual output, like in the `<FancyList>` example.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots)"

  id: guide/components/provide-inject
  summary: This page assumes you've already read the Components Basics
  description: "# Provide / Inject\n\n> This page assumes you've already read the [Components Basics](../essentials/component-basics). Read that first if you are new to components.\n\n## Prop Drilling\n\nUsually, when we need to pass data from the parent to a child component, we use [props](props). However, imagine the case where we have a large component tree, and a deeply nested component needs something from a distant ancestor component. With only props, we would have to pass the same prop across the entire parent chain:\n\nNotice although the `<Footer>` component may not care about these props at all, it still needs to declare and pass them along just so `<DeepChild>` can access them. If there is a longer parent chain, more components would be affected along the way. This is called \"props drilling\" and definitely isn't fun to deal with.\n\nWe can solve props drilling with `provide` and `inject`. A parent component can serve as a **dependency provider** for all its descendants. Any component in the descendant tree, regardless of how deep it is, can **inject** dependencies provided by components up in its parent chain.\n\n## Provide\n\nTo provide data to a component's descendants, use the [`provide()`](../../api/composition-api-dependency-injection#provide) function:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { provide } from 'vue'\n\nprovide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')\n</script>\n```\n\nIf not using `<script setup>`, make sure `provide()` is called synchronously inside `setup()`:\n\n``` js\nimport { provide } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `provide()` function accepts two arguments. The first argument is called the **injection key**, which can be a string or a `Symbol`. The injection key is used by descendant components to lookup the desired value to inject. A single component can call `provide()` multiple times with different injection keys to provide different values.\n\nThe second argument is the provided value. The value can be of any type, including reactive state such as refs:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref, provide } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\nprovide('key', count)\n```\n\nProviding reactive values allows the descendant components using the provided value to establish a reactive connection to the provider component.\n\nTo provide data to a component's descendants, use the [`provide`](../../api/options-composition#provide) option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  provide: {\n    message: 'hello!'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor each property in the `provide` object, the key is used by child components to locate the correct value to inject, while the value is what ends up being injected.\n\nIf we need to provide per-instance state, for example data declared via the `data()`, then `provide` must use a function value:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'hello!'\n    }\n  },\n  provide() {\n    // use function syntax so that we can access `this`\n    return {\n      message: this.message\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, do note this does **not** make the injection reactive. We will discuss [making injections reactive](#working-with-reactivity) below.\n\n## App-level Provide\n\nIn addition to providing data in a component, we can also provide at the app level:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({})\n\napp.provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')\n```\n\nApp-level provides are available to all components rendered in the app. This is especially useful when writing [plugins](../reusability/plugins), as plugins typically wouldn't be able to provide values using components.\n\n## Inject\n\nTo inject data provided by an ancestor component, use the [`inject()`](../../api/composition-api-dependency-injection#inject) function:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { inject } from 'vue'\n\nconst message = inject('message')\n</script>\n```\n\nIf the provided value is a ref, it will be injected as-is and will **not** be automatically unwrapped. This allows the injector component to retain the reactivity connection to the provider component.\n\n[Full provide + inject Example with Reactivity](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFUUFugzAQ/MrKF1IpxfeIVKp66Kk/8MWFDXYFtmUbpArx967BhURRU9/WOzO7MzuxV+fKcUB2YlWovXYRAsbBvQije2d9hAk8Xo7gvB11gzDDxdseCuIUG+ZN6a7JjZIvVRIlgDCcw+d3pmvTglz1okJ499I0C3qB1dJQT9YRooVaSdNiACWdQ5OICj2WwtTWhAg9hiBbhHNSOxQKu84WT8LkNQ9FBhTHXyg1K75aJHNUROxdJyNSBVBp44YI43NvG+zOgmWWYGt7dcipqPhGZEe2ef07wN3lltD+lWN6tNkV/37+rdKjK2rzhRTt7f3u41xhe37/xJZGAL2PLECXa9NKdD/a6QTTtGnP88LgiXJtYv4BaLHhvg==)\n\nAgain, if not using `<script setup>`, `inject()` should only be called synchronously inside `setup()`:\n\n``` js\nimport { inject } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const message = inject('message')\n    return { message }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo inject data provided by an ancestor component, use the [`inject`](../../api/options-composition#inject) option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  inject: ['message'],\n  created() {\n    console.log(this.message) // injected value\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInjections are resolved **before** the component's own state, so you can access injected properties in `data()`:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  inject: ['message'],\n  data() {\n    return {\n      // initial data based on injected value\n      fullMessage: this.message\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[Full provide + inject example](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNkcFqwzAQRH9l0EUthOhuRKH00FO/oO7B2JtERZaEvA4F43+vZCdOTAIJCImRdpi32kG8h7A99iQKobs6msBvpTNt8JHxcTC2wS76FnKrJpVLZelKR39TSUO7qreMoXRA7ZPPkeOuwHByj5v8EqI/moZeXudCIBL30Z0V0FLXVXsqIA9krU8R+XbMR9rS0mqhS4KpDbZiSgrQc5JKQqvlRWzEQnyvuc9YuWbd4eXq+TZn0IvzOeKr8FvsNcaK/R6Ocb9Uc4FvefpE+fMwP0wH8DU7wB77nIo6x6a2hvNEME5D0CpbrjnHf+8excI=)\n\n### Injection Aliasing\n\nWhen using the array syntax for `inject`, the injected properties are exposed on the component instance using the same key. In the example above, the property was provided under the key `\"message\"`, and injected as `this.message`. The local key is the same as the injection key.\n\nIf we want to inject the property using a different local key, we need to use the object syntax for the `inject` option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  inject: {\n    /* local key */ localMessage: {\n      from: /* injection key */ 'message'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, the component will locate a property provided with the key `\"message\"`, and then expose it as `this.localMessage`.\n\n### Injection Default Values\n\nBy default, `inject` assumes that the injected key is provided somewhere in the parent chain. In the case where the key is not provided, there will be a runtime warning.\n\nIf we want to make an injected property work with optional providers, we need to declare a default value, similar to props:\n\n``` js\n// `value` will be \"default value\"\n// if no data matching \"message\" was provided\nconst value = inject('message', 'default value')\n```\n\nIn some cases, the default value may need to be created by calling a function or instantiating a new class. To avoid unnecessary computation or side effects in case the optional value is not used, we can use a factory function for creating the default value:\n\n``` js\nconst value = inject('key', () => new ExpensiveClass(), true)\n```\n\nThe third parameter indicates the default value should be treated as a factory function.\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  // object syntax is required\n  // when declaring default values for injections\n  inject: {\n    message: {\n      from: 'message', // this is optional if using the same key for injection\n      default: 'default value'\n    },\n    user: {\n      // use a factory function for non-primitive values that are expensive\n      // to create, or ones that should be unique per component instance.\n      default: () => ({ name: 'John' })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Working with Reactivity\n\nWhen using reactive provide / inject values, **it is recommended to keep any mutations to reactive state inside of the *provider* whenever possible**. This ensures that the provided state and its possible mutations are co-located in the same component, making it easier to maintain in the future.\n\nThere may be times when we need to update the data from an injector component. In such cases, we recommend providing a function that is responsible for mutating the state:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- inside provider component -->\n<script setup>\nimport { provide, ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst location = ref('North Pole')\n\nfunction updateLocation() {\n  location.value = 'South Pole'\n}\n\nprovide('location', {\n  location,\n  updateLocation\n})\n</script>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- in injector component -->\n<script setup>\nimport { inject } from 'vue'\n\nconst { location, updateLocation } = inject('location')\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"updateLocation\">{{ location }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\nFinally, you can wrap the provided value with [`readonly()`](../../api/reactivity-core#readonly) if you want to ensure that the data passed through `provide` cannot be mutated by the injector component.\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, provide, readonly } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\nprovide('read-only-count', readonly(count))\n</script>\n```\n\nIn order to make injections reactively linked to the provider, we need to provide a computed property using the [computed()](../../api/reactivity-core#computed) function:\n\n``` js\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'hello!'\n    }\n  },\n  provide() {\n    return {\n      // explicitly provide a computed property\n      message: computed(() => this.message)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[Full provide + inject Example with Reactivity](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNUctqwzAQ/JVFFyeQxnfjBEoPPfULqh6EtYlV9EKWTcH43ytZtmPTQA0CsdqZ2dlRT16tPXctkoKUTeWE9VeqhbLGeXirheRwc0ZBds7HKkKzBdBDZZRtPXIYJlzqU40/I4LjjbUyIKmGEWw0at8UgZrUh1PscObZ4ZhQAA596/RcAShsGnbHArIapTRBP74O8Up060wnOO5QmP0eAvZyBV+L5jw1j2tZqsMp8yWRUHhUVjKPoQIohQ460L0ow1FeKJlEKEnttFweijJfiORElhCf5f3umObb0B9PU/I7kk17PJj7FloN/2t7a2Pj/Zkdob+x8gV8ZlMs2de/8+14AXwkBngD9zgVqjg2rNXPvwjD+EdlHilrn8MvtvD1+Q==)\n\nThe `computed()` function is typically used in Composition API components, but can also be used to complement certain use cases in Options API. You can learn more about its usage by reading the [Reactivity Fundamentals](../essentials/reactivity-fundamentals) and [Computed Properties](../essentials/computed) with the API Preference set to Composition API.\n\n## Working with Symbol Keys\n\nSo far, we have been using string injection keys in the examples. If you are working in a large application with many dependency providers, or you are authoring components that are going to be used by other developers, it is best to use Symbol injection keys to avoid potential collisions.\n\nIt's recommended to export the Symbols in a dedicated file:\n\n``` js\n// keys.js\nexport const myInjectionKey = Symbol()\n```\n\n``` js\n// in provider component\nimport { provide } from 'vue'\nimport { myInjectionKey } from './keys.js'\n\nprovide(myInjectionKey, {\n  /* data to provide */\n})\n```\n\n``` js\n// in injector component\nimport { inject } from 'vue'\nimport { myInjectionKey } from './keys.js'\n\nconst injected = inject(myInjectionKey)\n```\n\nSee also: [Typing Provide / Inject](../typescript/composition-api#typing-provide-inject)\n\n``` js\n// in provider component\nimport { myInjectionKey } from './keys.js'\n\nexport default {\n  provide() {\n    return {\n      [myInjectionKey]: {\n        /* data to provide */\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// in injector component\nimport { myInjectionKey } from './keys.js'\n\nexport default {\n  inject: {\n    injected: { from: myInjectionKey }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject)"

  id: guide/components/async
  summary: In large applications, we may need to divide the app into smaller chunks and only load a component from the server when it's needed
  description: "# Async Components\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn large applications, we may need to divide the app into smaller chunks and only load a component from the server when it's needed. To make that possible, Vue has a [`defineAsyncComponent`](../../api/general#defineasynccomponent) function:\n\n``` js\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nconst AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent(() => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    // ...load component from server\n    resolve(/* loaded component */)\n  })\n})\n// ... use `AsyncComp` like a normal component\n```\n\nAs you can see, `defineAsyncComponent` accepts a loader function that returns a Promise. The Promise's `resolve` callback should be called when you have retrieved your component definition from the server. You can also call `reject(reason)` to indicate the load has failed.\n\n[ES module dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) also returns a Promise, so most of the time we will use it in combination with `defineAsyncComponent`. Bundlers like Vite and webpack also support the syntax (and will use it as bundle split points), so we can use it to import Vue SFCs:\n\n``` js\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nconst AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent(() =>\n  import('./components/MyComponent.vue')\n)\n```\n\nThe resulting `AsyncComp` is a wrapper component that only calls the loader function when it is actually rendered on the page. In addition, it will pass along any props and slots to the inner component, so you can use the async wrapper to seamlessly replace the original component while achieving lazy loading.\n\nAs with normal components, async components can be [registered globally](registration#global-registration) using `app.component()`:\n\n``` js\napp.component('MyComponent', defineAsyncComponent(() =>\n  import('./components/MyComponent.vue')\n))\n```\n\nYou can also use `defineAsyncComponent` when [registering a component locally](registration#local-registration):\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    AdminPage: defineAsyncComponent(() =>\n      import('./components/AdminPageComponent.vue')\n    )\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <AdminPage />\n</template>\n```\n\nThey can also be defined directly inside their parent component:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nconst AdminPage = defineAsyncComponent(() =>\n  import('./components/AdminPageComponent.vue')\n)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <AdminPage />\n</template>\n```\n\n## Loading and Error States\n\nAsynchronous operations inevitably involve loading and error states - `defineAsyncComponent()` supports handling these states via advanced options:\n\n``` js\nconst AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent({\n  // the loader function\n  loader: () => import('./Foo.vue'),\n\n  // A component to use while the async component is loading\n  loadingComponent: LoadingComponent,\n  // Delay before showing the loading component. Default: 200ms.\n  delay: 200,\n\n  // A component to use if the load fails\n  errorComponent: ErrorComponent,\n  // The error component will be displayed if a timeout is\n  // provided and exceeded. Default: Infinity.\n  timeout: 3000\n})\n```\n\nIf a loading component is provided, it will be displayed first while the inner component is being loaded. There is a default 200ms delay before the loading component is shown - this is because on fast networks, an instant loading state may get replaced too fast and end up looking like a flicker.\n\nIf an error component is provided, it will be displayed when the Promise returned by the loader function is rejected. You can also specify a timeout to show the error component when the request is taking too long.\n\n## Using with Suspense\n\nAsync components can be used with the `<Suspense>` built-in component. The interaction between `<Suspense>` and async components is documented in the [dedicated chapter for `<Suspense>`](../built-ins/suspense).\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async)"

  id: guide/reusability/composables
  summary: This section assumes basic knowledge of Composition API
  description: "# Composables\n\n**TIP**\n\nThis section assumes basic knowledge of Composition API. If you have been learning Vue with Options API only, you can set the API Preference to Composition API (using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar) and re-read the [Reactivity Fundamentals](../essentials/reactivity-fundamentals) and [Lifecycle Hooks](../essentials/lifecycle) chapters.\n\n## What is a \"Composable\"?\n\nIn the context of Vue applications, a \"composable\" is a function that leverages Vue's Composition API to encapsulate and reuse **stateful logic**.\n\nWhen building frontend applications, we often need to reuse logic for common tasks. For example, we may need to format dates in many places, so we extract a reusable function for that. This formatter function encapsulates **stateless logic**: it takes some input and immediately returns expected output. There are many libraries out there for reusing stateless logic - for example [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), which you may have heard of.\n\nBy contrast, stateful logic involves managing state that changes over time. A simple example would be tracking the current position of the mouse on a page. In real-world scenarios, it could also be more complex logic such as touch gestures or connection status to a database.\n\n## Mouse Tracker Example\n\nIf we were to implement the mouse tracking functionality using the Composition API directly inside a component, it would look like this:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'\n\nconst x = ref(0)\nconst y = ref(0)\n\nfunction update(event) {\n  x.value = event.pageX\n  y.value = event.pageY\n}\n\nonMounted(() => window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))\nonUnmounted(() => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))\n</script>\n\n<template>Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}</template>\n```\n\nBut what if we want to reuse the same logic in multiple components? We can extract the logic into an external file, as a composable function:\n\n``` js\n// mouse.js\nimport { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'\n\n// by convention, composable function names start with \"use\"\nexport function useMouse() {\n  // state encapsulated and managed by the composable\n  const x = ref(0)\n  const y = ref(0)\n\n  // a composable can update its managed state over time.\n  function update(event) {\n    x.value = event.pageX\n    y.value = event.pageY\n  }\n\n  // a composable can also hook into its owner component's\n  // lifecycle to setup and teardown side effects.\n  onMounted(() => window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))\n  onUnmounted(() => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))\n\n  // expose managed state as return value\n  return { x, y }\n}\n```\n\nAnd this is how it can be used in components:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { useMouse } from './mouse.js'\n\nconst { x, y } = useMouse()\n</script>\n\n<template>Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNkj1rwzAQhv/KocUOGKVzSAIdurVjoQUvJj4XlfgkJNmxMfrvPcmJkkKHLrbu69H7SlrEszFyHFDsxN6drDIeHPrBHGtSvdHWwwKDwzfNHwjQWd1DIbd9jOW3K2qq6aTJxb6pgpl7Dnmg3NS0365YBnLgsTfnxiNHACvUaKe80gTKQeN3sDAIQqjignEhIvKYqMRta1acFVrsKtDEQPLYxuU7cV8Msmg2mdTilIa6gU5p27tYWKKq1c3ENphaPrGFW25+yMXsHWFaFlfiiOSvFIBJjs15QJ5JeWmaL/xYS/Mfpc9YYrPxl52ULOpwhIuiVl9k07Yvsf9VOY+EtizSWfR6xKK6itgkvQ/+fyNs6v4XJXIsPwVL+WprCiL8AEUxw5s=)\n\nAs we can see, the core logic remains identical - all we had to do was move it into an external function and return the state that should be exposed. Just like inside a component, you can use the full range of [Composition API functions](../../api/index#composition-api) in composables. The same `useMouse()` functionality can now be used in any component.\n\nThe cooler part about composables though, is that you can also nest them: one composable function can call one or more other composable functions. This enables us to compose complex logic using small, isolated units, similar to how we compose an entire application using components. In fact, this is why we decided to call the collection of APIs that make this pattern possible Composition API.\n\nFor example, we can extract the logic of adding and removing a DOM event listener into its own composable:\n\n``` js\n// event.js\nimport { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useEventListener(target, event, callback) {\n  // if you want, you can also make this\n  // support selector strings as target\n  onMounted(() => target.addEventListener(event, callback))\n  onUnmounted(() => target.removeEventListener(event, callback))\n}\n```\n\nAnd now our `useMouse()` composable can be simplified to:\n\n``` js\n// mouse.js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nimport { useEventListener } from './event'\n\nexport function useMouse() {\n  const x = ref(0)\n  const y = ref(0)\n\n  useEventListener(window, 'mousemove', (event) => {\n    x.value = event.pageX\n    y.value = event.pageY\n  })\n\n  return { x, y }\n}\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nEach component instance calling `useMouse()` will create its own copies of `x` and `y` state so they won't interfere with one another. If you want to manage shared state between components, read the [State Management](../scaling-up/state-management) chapter.\n\n## Async State Example\n\nThe `useMouse()` composable doesn't take any arguments, so let's take a look at another example that makes use of one. When doing async data fetching, we often need to handle different states: loading, success, and error:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst data = ref(null)\nconst error = ref(null)\n\nfetch('...')\n  .then((res) => res.json())\n  .then((json) => (data.value = json))\n  .catch((err) => (error.value = err))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div v-if=\"error\">Oops! Error encountered: {{ error.message }}</div>\n  <div v-else-if=\"data\">\n    Data loaded:\n    <pre>{{ data }}</pre>\n  </div>\n  <div v-else>Loading...</div>\n</template>\n```\n\nIt would be tedious to have to repeat this pattern in every component that needs to fetch data. Let's extract it into a composable:\n\n``` js\n// fetch.js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useFetch(url) {\n  const data = ref(null)\n  const error = ref(null)\n\n  fetch(url)\n    .then((res) => res.json())\n    .then((json) => (data.value = json))\n    .catch((err) => (error.value = err))\n\n  return { data, error }\n}\n```\n\nNow in our component we can just do:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { useFetch } from './fetch.js'\n\nconst { data, error } = useFetch('...')\n</script>\n```\n\n### Accepting Reactive State\n\n`useFetch()` takes a static URL string as input - so it performs the fetch only once and is then done. What if we want it to re-fetch whenever the URL changes? In order to achieve this, we need to pass reactive state into the composable function, and let the composable create watchers that perform actions using the passed state.\n\nFor example, `useFetch()` should be able to accept a ref:\n\n``` js\nconst url = ref('/initial-url')\n\nconst { data, error } = useFetch(url)\n\n// this should trigger a re-fetch\nurl.value = '/new-url'\n```\n\nOr, accept a getter function:\n\n``` js\n// re-fetch when props.id changes\nconst { data, error } = useFetch(() => `/posts/${props.id}`)\n```\n\nWe can refactor our existing implementation with the [`watchEffect()`](../../api/reactivity-core#watcheffect) and [`toValue()`](../../api/reactivity-utilities#tovalue) APIs:\n\n``` js\n// fetch.js\nimport { ref, watchEffect, toValue } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useFetch(url) {\n  const data = ref(null)\n  const error = ref(null)\n\n  const fetchData = () => {\n    // reset state before fetching..\n    data.value = null\n    error.value = null\n\n    fetch(toValue(url))\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((json) => (data.value = json))\n      .catch((err) => (error.value = err))\n  }\n\n  watchEffect(() => {\n    fetchData()\n  })\n\n  return { data, error }\n}\n```\n\n`toValue()` is an API added in 3.3. It is designed to normalize refs or getters into values. If the argument is a ref, it returns the ref's value; if the argument is a function, it will call the function and return its return value. Otherwise, it returns the argument as-is. It works similarly to [`unref()`](../../api/reactivity-utilities#unref), but with special treatment for functions.\n\nNotice that `toValue(url)` is called **inside** the `watchEffect` callback. This ensures that any reactive dependencies accessed during the `toValue()` normalization are tracked by the watcher.\n\nThis version of `useFetch()` now accepts static URL strings, refs, and getters, making it much more flexible. The watch effect will run immediately, and will track any dependencies accessed during `toValue(url)`. If no dependencies are tracked (e.g. url is already a string), the effect runs only once; otherwise, it will re-run whenever a tracked dependency changes.\n\nHere's [the updated version of `useFetch()`](https://play.vuejs.org/#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), with an artificial delay and randomized error for demo purposes.\n\n## Conventions and Best Practices\n\n### Naming\n\nIt is a convention to name composable functions with camelCase names that start with \"use\".\n\n### Input Arguments\n\nA composable can accept ref or getter arguments even if it doesn't rely on them for reactivity. If you are writing a composable that may be used by other developers, it's a good idea to handle the case of input arguments being refs or getters instead of raw values. The [`toValue()`](../../api/reactivity-utilities#tovalue) utility function will come in handy for this purpose:\n\n``` js\nimport { toValue } from 'vue'\n\nfunction useFeature(maybeRefOrGetter) {\n  // If maybeRefOrGetter is a ref or a getter,\n  // its normalized value will be returned.\n  // Otherwise, it is returned as-is.\n  const value = toValue(maybeRefOrGetter)\n}\n```\n\nIf your composable creates reactive effects when the input is a ref or a getter, make sure to either explicitly watch the ref / getter with `watch()`, or call `toValue()` inside a `watchEffect()` so that it is properly tracked.\n\nThe [useFetch() implementation discussed earlier](#accepting-reactive-state) provides a concrete example of a composable that accepts refs, getters and plain values as input argument.\n\n### Return Values\n\nYou have probably noticed that we have been exclusively using `ref()` instead of `reactive()` in composables. The recommended convention is for composables to always return a plain, non-reactive object containing multiple refs. This allows it to be destructured in components while retaining reactivity:\n\n``` js\n// x and y are refs\nconst { x, y } = useMouse()\n```\n\nReturning a reactive object from a composable will cause such destructures to lose the reactivity connection to the state inside the composable, while the refs will retain that connection.\n\nIf you prefer to use returned state from composables as object properties, you can wrap the returned object with `reactive()` so that the refs are unwrapped. For example:\n\n``` js\nconst mouse = reactive(useMouse())\n// mouse.x is linked to original ref\nconsole.log(mouse.x)\n```\n\n``` template\nMouse position is at: {{ mouse.x }}, {{ mouse.y }}\n```\n\n### Side Effects\n\nIt is OK to perform side effects (e.g. adding DOM event listeners or fetching data) in composables, but pay attention to the following rules:\n\n- If you are working on an application that uses [Server-Side Rendering](../scaling-up/ssr) (SSR), make sure to perform DOM-specific side effects in post-mount lifecycle hooks, e.g. `onMounted()`. These hooks are only called in the browser, so you can be sure that code inside them has access to the DOM.\n\n- Remember to clean up side effects in `onUnmounted()`. For example, if a composable sets up a DOM event listener, it should remove that listener in `onUnmounted()` as we have seen in the `useMouse()` example. It can be a good idea to use a composable that automatically does this for you, like the `useEventListener()` example.\n\n### Usage Restrictions\n\nComposables should only be called in `<script setup>` or the `setup()` hook. They should also be called **synchronously** in these contexts. In some cases, you can also call them in lifecycle hooks like `onMounted()`.\n\nThese restrictions are important because these are the contexts where Vue is able to determine the current active component instance. Access to an active component instance is necessary so that:\n\n1.  Lifecycle hooks can be registered to it.\n\n2.  Computed properties and watchers can be linked to it, so that they can be disposed when the instance is unmounted to prevent memory leaks.\n\n**TIP**\n\n`<script setup>` is the only place where you can call composables **after** using `await`. The compiler automatically restores the active instance context for you after the async operation.\n\n## Extracting Composables for Code Organization\n\nComposables can be extracted not only for reuse, but also for code organization. As the complexity of your components grow, you may end up with components that are too large to navigate and reason about. Composition API gives you the full flexibility to organize your component code into smaller functions based on logical concerns:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { useFeatureA } from './featureA.js'\nimport { useFeatureB } from './featureB.js'\nimport { useFeatureC } from './featureC.js'\n\nconst { foo, bar } = useFeatureA()\nconst { baz } = useFeatureB(foo)\nconst { qux } = useFeatureC(baz)\n</script>\n```\n\nTo some extent, you can think of these extracted composables as component-scoped services that can talk to one another.\n\n## Using Composables in Options API\n\nIf you are using Options API, composables must be called inside `setup()`, and the returned bindings must be returned from `setup()` so that they are exposed to `this` and the template:\n\n``` js\nimport { useMouse } from './mouse.js'\nimport { useFetch } from './fetch.js'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const { x, y } = useMouse()\n    const { data, error } = useFetch('...')\n    return { x, y, data, error }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    // setup() exposed properties can be accessed on `this`\n    console.log(this.x)\n  }\n  // ...other options\n}\n```\n\n## Comparisons with Other Techniques\n\n### vs. Mixins\n\nUsers coming from Vue 2 may be familiar with the [mixins](../../api/options-composition#mixins) option, which also allows us to extract component logic into reusable units. There are three primary drawbacks to mixins:\n\n1.  **Unclear source of properties**: when using many mixins, it becomes unclear which instance property is injected by which mixin, making it difficult to trace the implementation and understand the component's behavior. This is also why we recommend using the refs + destructure pattern for composables: it makes the property source clear in consuming components.\n\n2.  **Namespace collisions**: multiple mixins from different authors can potentially register the same property keys, causing namespace collisions. With composables, you can rename the destructured variables if there are conflicting keys from different composables.\n\n3.  **Implicit cross-mixin communication**: multiple mixins that need to interact with one another have to rely on shared property keys, making them implicitly coupled. With composables, values returned from one composable can be passed into another as arguments, just like normal functions.\n\nFor the above reasons, we no longer recommend using mixins in Vue 3. The feature is kept only for migration and familiarity reasons.\n\n### vs. Renderless Components\n\nIn the component slots chapter, we discussed the [Renderless Component](../components/slots#renderless-components) pattern based on scoped slots. We even implemented the same mouse tracking demo using renderless components.\n\nThe main advantage of composables over renderless components is that composables do not incur the extra component instance overhead. When used across an entire application, the amount of extra component instances created by the renderless component pattern can become a noticeable performance overhead.\n\nThe recommendation is to use composables when reusing pure logic, and use components when reusing both logic and visual layout.\n\n### vs. React Hooks\n\nIf you have experience with React, you may notice that this looks very similar to custom React hooks. Composition API was in part inspired by React hooks, and Vue composables are indeed similar to React hooks in terms of logic composition capabilities. However, Vue composables are based on Vue's fine-grained reactivity system, which is fundamentally different from React hooks' execution model. This is discussed in more detail in the [Composition API FAQ](../extras/composition-api-faq#comparison-with-react-hooks).\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [Reactivity In Depth](../extras/reactivity-in-depth): for a low-level understanding of how Vue's reactivity system works.\n- [State Management](../scaling-up/state-management): for patterns of managing state shared by multiple components.\n- [Testing Composables](../scaling-up/testing#testing-composables): tips on unit testing composables.\n- [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/): an ever-growing collection of Vue composables.

- name: 25. Custom Directives  (Reusability)
  id: guide/reusability/custom-directives
  summary: In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like v-model or v-show), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives
  description: "# Custom Directives\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like `v-model` or `v-show`), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives.\n\nWe have introduced two forms of code reuse in Vue: [components](../essentials/component-basics) and [composables](composables). Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.\n\nA custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. Here is an example of a directive that focuses an input when the element is inserted into the DOM by Vue:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\n// enables v-focus in templates\nconst vFocus = {\n  mounted: (el) => el.focus()\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input v-focus />\n</template>\n```\n\n``` js\nconst focus = {\n  mounted: (el) => el.focus()\n}\n\nexport default {\n  directives: {\n    // enables v-focus in template\n    focus\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<input v-focus />\n```\n\nAssuming you haven't clicked elsewhere on the page, the input above should be auto-focused. This directive is more useful than the `autofocus` attribute because it works not just on page load - it also works when the element is dynamically inserted by Vue.\n\nIn `<script setup>`, any camelCase variable that starts with the `v` prefix can be used as a custom directive. In the example above, `vFocus` can be used in the template as `v-focus`.\n\nIf not using `<script setup>`, custom directives can be registered using the `directives` option:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    /*...*/\n  },\n  directives: {\n    // enables v-focus in template\n    focus: {\n      /* ... */\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to components, custom directives must be registered so that they can be used in templates. In the example above, we are using local registration via the `directives` option.\n\nIt is also common to globally register custom directives at the app level:\n\n``` js\nconst app = createApp({})\n\n// make v-focus usable in all components\napp.directive('focus', {\n  /* ... */\n})\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nCustom directives should only be used when the desired functionality can only be achieved via direct DOM manipulation. Prefer declarative templating using built-in directives such as `v-bind` when possible because they are more efficient and server-rendering friendly.\n\n## Directive Hooks\n\nA directive definition object can provide several hook functions (all optional):\n\n``` js\nconst myDirective = {\n  // called before bound element's attributes\n  // or event listeners are applied\n  created(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {\n    // see below for details on arguments\n  },\n  // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.\n  beforeMount(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},\n  // called when the bound element's parent component\n  // and all its children are mounted.\n  mounted(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},\n  // called before the parent component is updated\n  beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},\n  // called after the parent component and\n  // all of its children have updated\n  updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},\n  // called before the parent component is unmounted\n  beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},\n  // called when the parent component is unmounted\n  unmounted(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {}\n}\n```\n\n### Hook Arguments\n\nDirective hooks are passed these arguments:\n\n- `el`: the element the directive is bound to. This can be used to directly manipulate the DOM.\n\n- `binding`: an object containing the following properties.\n\n  - `value`: The value passed to the directive. For example in `v-my-directive=\"1 + 1\"`, the value would be `2`.\n  - `oldValue`: The previous value, only available in `beforeUpdate` and `updated`. It is available whether or not the value has changed.\n  - `arg`: The argument passed to the directive, if any. For example in `v-my-directive:foo`, the arg would be `\"foo\"`.\n  - `modifiers`: An object containing modifiers, if any. For example in `v-my-directive.foo.bar`, the modifiers object would be `{ foo: true, bar: true }`.\n  - `instance`: The instance of the component where the directive is used.\n  - `dir`: the directive definition object.\n\n- `vnode`: the underlying VNode representing the bound element.\n\n- `prevNode`: the VNode representing the bound element from the previous render. Only available in the `beforeUpdate` and `updated` hooks.\n\nAs an example, consider the following directive usage:\n\n``` template\n<div v-example:foo.bar=\"baz\">\n```\n\nThe `binding` argument would be an object in the shape of:\n\n``` js\n{\n  arg: 'foo',\n  modifiers: { bar: true },\n  value: /* value of `baz` */,\n  oldValue: /* value of `baz` from previous update */\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to built-in directives, custom directive arguments can be dynamic. For example:\n\n``` template\n<div v-example:[arg]=\"value\"></div>\n```\n\nHere the directive argument will be reactively updated based on `arg` property in our component state.\n\n**Note**\n\nApart from `el`, you should treat these arguments as read-only and never modify them. If you need to share information across hooks, it is recommended to do so through element's [dataset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset).\n\n## Function Shorthand\n\nIt's common for a custom directive to have the same behavior for `mounted` and `updated`, with no need for the other hooks. In such cases we can define the directive as a function:\n\n``` template\n<div v-color=\"color\"></div>\n```\n\n``` js\napp.directive('color', (el, binding) => {\n  // this will be called for both `mounted` and `updated`\n  el.style.color = binding.value\n})\n```\n\n## Object Literals\n\nIf your directive needs multiple values, you can also pass in a JavaScript object literal. Remember, directives can take any valid JavaScript expression.\n\n``` template\n<div v-demo=\"{ color: 'white', text: 'hello!' }\"></div>\n```\n\n``` js\napp.directive('demo', (el, binding) => {\n  console.log(binding.value.color) // => \"white\"\n  console.log(binding.value.text) // => \"hello!\"\n})\n```\n\n## Usage on Components\n\nWhen used on components, custom directives will always apply to a component's root node, similar to [Fallthrough Attributes](../components/attrs).\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent v-demo=\"test\" />\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- template of MyComponent -->\n\n<div> <!-- v-demo directive will be applied here -->\n  <span>My component content</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nNote that components can potentially have more than one root node. When applied to a multi-root component, a directive will be ignored and a warning will be thrown. Unlike attributes, directives can't be passed to a different element with `v-bind=\"$attrs\"`. In general, it is **not** recommended to use custom directives on components.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/custom-directives](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/custom-directives)"
- name: 26. Plugins  (Reusability)
  id: guide/reusability/plugins
  summary: Plugins are self-contained code that usually add app-level functionality to Vue
  description: "# Plugins\n\n## Introduction\n\nPlugins are self-contained code that usually add app-level functionality to Vue. This is how we install a plugin:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({})\n\napp.use(myPlugin, {\n  /* optional options */\n})\n```\n\nA plugin is defined as either an object that exposes an `install()` method, or simply a function that acts as the install function itself. The install function receives the [app instance](../../api/application) along with additional options passed to `app.use()`, if any:\n\n``` js\nconst myPlugin = {\n  install(app, options) {\n    // configure the app\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere is no strictly defined scope for a plugin, but common scenarios where plugins are useful include:\n\n1.  Register one or more global components or custom directives with [`app.component()`](../../api/application#app-component) and [`app.directive()`](../../api/application#app-directive).\n\n2.  Make a resource [injectable](../components/provide-inject) throughout the app by calling [`app.provide()`](../../api/application#app-provide).\n\n3.  Add some global instance properties or methods by attaching them to [`app.config.globalProperties`](../../api/application#app-config-globalproperties).\n\n4.  A library that needs to perform some combination of the above (e.g. [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next)).\n\n## Writing a Plugin\n\nIn order to better understand how to create your own Vue.js plugins, we will create a very simplified version of a plugin that displays `i18n` (short for [Internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)) strings.\n\nLet's begin by setting up the plugin object. It is recommended to create it in a separate file and export it, as shown below to keep the logic contained and separate.\n\n``` js\n// plugins/i18n.js\nexport default {\n  install: (app, options) => {\n    // Plugin code goes here\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe want to create a translation function. This function will receive a dot-delimited `key` string, which we will use to look up the translated string in the user-provided options. This is the intended usage in templates:\n\n``` template\n<h1>{{ $translate('greetings.hello') }}</h1>\n```\n\nSince this function should be globally available in all templates, we will make it so by attaching it to `app.config.globalProperties` in our plugin:\n\n``` js\n// plugins/i18n.js\nexport default {\n  install: (app, options) => {\n    // inject a globally available $translate() method\n    app.config.globalProperties.$translate = (key) => {\n      // retrieve a nested property in `options`\n      // using `key` as the path\n      return key.split('.').reduce((o, i) => {\n        if (o) return o[i]\n      }, options)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOur `$translate` function will take a string such as `greetings.hello`, look inside the user provided configuration and return the translated value.\n\nThe object containing the translated keys should be passed to the plugin during installation via additional parameters to `app.use()`:\n\n``` js\nimport i18nPlugin from './plugins/i18n'\n\napp.use(i18nPlugin, {\n  greetings: {\n    hello: 'Bonjour!'\n  }\n})\n```\n\nNow, our initial expression `$translate('greetings.hello')` will be replaced by `Bonjour!` at runtime.\n\nSee also: [Augmenting Global Properties](../typescript/options-api#augmenting-global-properties)\n\n**TIP**\n\nUse global properties scarcely, since it can quickly become confusing if too many global properties injected by different plugins are used throughout an app.\n\n### Provide / Inject with Plugins\n\nPlugins also allow us to use `inject` to provide a function or attribute to the plugin's users. For example, we can allow the application to have access to the `options` parameter to be able to use the translations object.\n\n``` js\n// plugins/i18n.js\nexport default {\n  install: (app, options) => {\n    app.provide('i18n', options)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlugin users will now be able to inject the plugin options into their components using the `i18n` key:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { inject } from 'vue'\n\nconst i18n = inject('i18n')\n\nconsole.log(i18n.greetings.hello)\n</script>\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  inject: ['i18n'],\n  created() {\n    console.log(this.i18n.greetings.hello)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/plugins](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/plugins)"

  summary: <Transition> for applying animations when an element or component is entering and leaving the DOM
  description: "# Transition\n\nVue offers two built-in components that can help work with transitions and animations in response to changing state:\n\n- `<Transition>` for applying animations when an element or component is entering and leaving the DOM. This is covered on this page.\n\n- `<TransitionGroup>` for applying animations when an element or component is inserted into, removed from, or moved within a `v-for` list. This is covered in [the next chapter](transition-group).\n\nAside from these two components, we can also apply animations in Vue using other techniques such as toggling CSS classes or state-driven animations via style bindings. These additional techniques are covered in the [Animation Techniques](../extras/animation) chapter.\n\n## The `<Transition>` Component\n\n`<Transition>` is a built-in component: this means it is available in any component's template without having to register it. It can be used to apply enter and leave animations on elements or components passed to it via its default slot. The enter or leave can be triggered by one of the following:\n\n- Conditional rendering via `v-if`\n- Conditional display via `v-show`\n- Dynamic components toggling via the `<component>` special element\n- Changing the special `key` attribute\n\nThis is an example of the most basic usage:\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"show = !show\">Toggle</button>\n<Transition>\n  <p v-if=\"show\">hello</p>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n``` css\n/* we will explain what these classes do next! */\n.v-enter-active,\n.v-leave-active {\n  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.v-enter-from,\n.v-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpVkEFuwyAQRa8yZZNWqu1sunFJ1N4hSzYUjRNUDAjGVJHluxcCipIV/OG/pxEr+/a+TwuykfGogvYEEWnxR2H17F0gWCHgBBtMwc2wy9WdsMIqZ2OuXtwfHErhlcKCb8LyoVoynwPh7I0kzAmA/yxEzsKXMlr9HgRr9Es5BTue3PlskA+1VpFTkDZq0i3niYfU6anRmbqgMY4PZeH8OjwBfHhYIMdIV1OuferQEoZOKtIJ328TgzJhm8BabHR3jeC8VJqusO8/IqCM+CnsVqR3V/mfRxO5amnkCPuK5B+6rcG2fydshks=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpVkMFuAiEQhl9lyqlNuouXXrZo2nfwuBeKs0qKQGBAjfHdZZfVrAmB+f/M/2WGK/v1vs0JWcdEVEF72vQWz94Fgh0OMhmCa28BdpLk+0etAQJSCvahAOLBnTqgkLA6t/EpVzmCP7lFEB69kYRFAYi/ROQs/Cij1f+6ZyMG1vA2vj3bbN1+b1Dw2lYj2yBt1KRnXRwPudHDnC6pAxrjBPe1n78EBF8MUGSkixnLNjdoCUMjFemMn5NjUGacnboqPVkdOC+Vpgus2q8IKCN+T+suWENwxyWJXKXMyQ5WNVJ+aBqD3e6VSYoi)\n\n**TIP**\n\n`<Transition>` only supports a single element or component as its slot content. If the content is a component, the component must also have only one single root element.\n\nWhen an element in a `<Transition>` component is inserted or removed, this is what happens:\n\n1.  Vue will automatically sniff whether the target element has CSS transitions or animations applied. If it does, a number of [CSS transition classes](#transition-classes) will be added / removed at appropriate timings.\n\n2.  If there are listeners for [JavaScript hooks](#javascript-hooks), these hooks will be called at appropriate timings.\n\n3.  If no CSS transitions / animations are detected and no JavaScript hooks are provided, the DOM operations for insertion and/or removal will be executed on the browser's next animation frame.\n\n## CSS-Based Transitions\n\n### Transition Classes\n\nThere are six classes applied for enter / leave transitions.\n\n1.  `v-enter-from`: Starting state for enter. Added before the element is inserted, removed one frame after the element is inserted.\n\n2.  `v-enter-active`: Active state for enter. Applied during the entire entering phase. Added before the element is inserted, removed when the transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the entering transition.\n\n3.  `v-enter-to`: Ending state for enter. Added one frame after the element is inserted (at the same time `v-enter-from` is removed), removed when the transition/animation finishes.\n\n4.  `v-leave-from`: Starting state for leave. Added immediately when a leaving transition is triggered, removed after one frame.\n\n5.  `v-leave-active`: Active state for leave. Applied during the entire leaving phase. Added immediately when a leaving transition is triggered, removed when the transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the leaving transition.\n\n6.  `v-leave-to`: Ending state for leave. Added one frame after a leaving transition is triggered (at the same time `v-leave-from` is removed), removed when the transition/animation finishes.\n\n`v-enter-active` and `v-leave-active` give us the ability to specify different easing curves for enter / leave transitions, which we'll see an example of in the following sections.\n\n### Named Transitions\n\nA transition can be named via the `name` prop:\n\n``` template\n<Transition name=\"fade\">\n  ...\n</Transition>\n```\n\nFor a named transition, its transition classes will be prefixed with its name instead of `v`. For example, the applied class for the above transition will be `fade-enter-active` instead of `v-enter-active`. The CSS for the fade transition should look like this:\n\n``` css\n.fade-enter-active,\n.fade-leave-active {\n  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.fade-enter-from,\n.fade-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n```\n\n### CSS Transitions\n\n`<Transition>` is most commonly used in combination with [native CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions), as seen in the basic example above. The `transition` CSS property is a shorthand that allows us to specify multiple aspects of a transition, including properties that should be animated, duration of the transition, and [easing curves](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function).\n\nHere is a more advanced example that transitions multiple properties, with different durations and easing curves for enter and leave:\n\n``` template\n<Transition name=\"slide-fade\">\n  <p v-if=\"show\">hello</p>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n``` css\n/*\n  Enter and leave animations can use different\n  durations and timing functions.\n*/\n.slide-fade-enter-active {\n  transition: all 0.3s ease-out;\n}\n\n.slide-fade-leave-active {\n  transition: all 0.8s cubic-bezier(1, 0.5, 0.8, 1);\n}\n\n.slide-fade-enter-from,\n.slide-fade-leave-to {\n  transform: translateX(20px);\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFkc9uwjAMxl/F6wXQKIVNk1AX0HbZC4zDDr2E4EK0NIkStxtDvPviFQ0OSFzyx/m+n+34kL16P+lazMpMRBW0J4hIrV9WVjfeBYIDBKzhCHVwDQySdFDZyipnY5Lu3BcsWDCk0OKosqLoKcmfLoSNN5KQbyTWLZGz8KKMVp+LKju573ivsuXKbbcG4d3oDcI9vMkNiqL3JD+AWAVpoyadGFY2yATW5nVSJj9rkspDl+v6hE/hHRrjRMEdpdfiDEkBUVxWaEWkveHj5AzO0RKGXCrSHcKBIfSPKEEaA9PJYwSUEXPX0nNlj8y6RBiUHd5AzCOodq1VvsYfjWE4G6fgEy/zMcxG17B9ZTyX8bV85C5y1S40ZX/kdj+GD1P/zVQA56XStC9h2idJI/z7huz4CxoVvE4=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFkc1uwjAMgF/F6wk0SmHTJNQFtF32AuOwQy+hdSFamkSJ08EQ776EbMAkJKTIf7I/O/Y+ezVm3HvMyoy52gpDi0rh1mhL0GDLvSTYVwqg4cQHw2QDWCRv1Z8H4Db6qwSyHlPkEFUQ4bHixA0OYWckJ4wesZUn0gpeainqz3mVRQzM4S7qKlss9XotEd6laBDu4Y03yIpUE+oB2NJy5QSJwFC8w0iIuXkbMkN9moUZ6HPR/uJDeINSalaYxCjOkBBgxeWEijnayWiOz+AcFaHNeU2ix7QCOiFK4FLCZPzoALnDXHt6Pq7hP0Ii7/EGYuag9itR5yv8FmgH01EIPkUxG8F0eA2bJmut7kbX+pG+6NVq28WTBTN+92PwMDHbSAXQhteCdiVMUpNwwuMassMP8kfAJQ==)\n\n### CSS Animations\n\n[Native CSS animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) are applied in the same way as CSS transitions, with the difference being that `*-enter-from` is not removed immediately after the element is inserted, but on an `animationend` event.\n\nFor most CSS animations, we can simply declare them under the `*-enter-active` and `*-leave-active` classes. Here's an example:\n\n``` template\n<Transition name=\"bounce\">\n  <p v-if=\"show\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    Hello here is some bouncy text!\n  </p>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n``` css\n.bounce-enter-active {\n  animation: bounce-in 0.5s;\n}\n.bounce-leave-active {\n  animation: bounce-in 0.5s reverse;\n}\n@keyframes bounce-in {\n  0% {\n    transform: scale(0);\n  }\n  50% {\n    transform: scale(1.25);\n  }\n  100% {\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNksGOgjAQhl9lJNmoBwRNvCAa97YP4JFLbQZsLG3TDqzG+O47BaOezCYkpfB9/0wHbsm3c4u+w6RIyiC9cgQBqXO7yqjWWU9wA4813KH2toUpo9PKVEZaExg92V/YRmBGvsN5ZcpsTGGfN4St04Iw7qg8dkTWwF5qJc/bKnnYk7hWye5gm0ZjmY0YKwDlwQsTFCnWjGiRpaPtjETG43smHPSpqh9pVQKBrjpyrfCNMilZV8Aqd5cNEF4oFVo1pgCJhtBvnjEAP6i1hRN6BBUg2BZhKHUdvMmjWhYHE9dXY/ygzN4PasqhB75djM2mQ7FUSFI9wi0GCJ6uiHYxVsFUGcgX67CpzP0lahQ9/k/kj9CjDzgG7M94rT1PLLxhQ0D+Na4AFI9QW98WEKTQOMvnLAOwDrD+wC0Xq/Ubusw/sU+QL/45hskk9z8Bddbn)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNUs2OwiAQfpWxySZ66I8mXioa97YP4LEXrNNKpEBg2tUY330pqOvJmBBgyPczP1yTb2OyocekTJirrTC0qRSejbYEB2x4LwmulQI4cOLTWbwDWKTeqkcE4I76twSyPcaX23j4zS+WP3V9QNgZyQnHiNi+J9IKtrUU9WldJaMMrGEynlWy2em2lcjyCPMUALazXDlBwtMU79CT9rpXNXp4tGYGhlQ0d7UqAUcXOeI6bluhUtKmhEVhzisgPFPKpWhVCTUqQrt6ygD8oJQajmgRhAOnO4RgdQm8yd0tNzGv/D8x/8Dy10IVCzn4axaTTYNZymsSA8YuciU6PrLL6IKpUFBkS7cKXXwQJfIBPyP6IQ1oHUaB7QkvjfUdcy+wIFB8PeZIYwmNtl0JruYSp8XMk+/TXL7BzbPF8gU6L95hn8D4OUJnktsfM1vavg==)\n\n### Custom Transition Classes\n\nYou can also specify custom transition classes by passing the following props to `<Transition>`:\n\n- `enter-from-class`\n- `enter-active-class`\n- `enter-to-class`\n- `leave-from-class`\n- `leave-active-class`\n- `leave-to-class`\n\nThese will override the conventional class names. This is especially useful when you want to combine Vue's transition system with an existing CSS animation library, such as [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/):\n\n``` template\n<!-- assuming Animate.css is included on the page -->\n<Transition\n  name=\"custom-classes\"\n  enter-active-class=\"animate__animated animate__tada\"\n  leave-active-class=\"animate__animated animate__bounceOutRight\"\n>\n  <p v-if=\"show\">hello</p>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNUctuwjAQ/BXXF9oDsZB6ogbRL6hUcbSEjLMhpn7JXtNWiH/vhqS0R3zxPmbWM+szf02pOVXgSy6LyTYhK4A1rVWwPsWM7MwydOzCuhw9mxF0poIKJoZC0D5+stUAeMRc4UkFKcYpxKcEwSenEYYM5b4ixsA2xlnzsVJ8Yj8Mt+LrbTwcHEgxwojCmNxmHYpFG2kaoxO0B2KaWjD6uXG6FCiKj00ICHmuDdoTjD2CavJBCna7KWjZrYK61b9cB5pI93P3sQYDbxXf7aHHccpVMolO7DS33WSQjPXgXJRi2Cl1xZ8nKkjxf0dBFvx2Q7iZtq94j5jKUgjThmNpjIu17ZzO0JjohT7qL+HsvohJWWNKEc/NolncKt6Goar4y/V7rg/wyw9zrLOy)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNUcFuwjAM/RUvp+1Ao0k7sYDYF0yaOFZCJjU0LE2ixGFMiH9f2gDbcVKU2M9+tl98Fm8hNMdMYi5U0tEEXraOTsFHho52mC3DuXUAHTI+PlUbIBLn6G4eQOr91xw4ZqrIZXzKVY6S97rFYRqCRabRY7XNzN7BSlujPxetGMvAAh7GtxXLtd/vLSlZ0woFQK0jumTY+FJt7ORwoMLUObEfZtpiSpRaUYPkmOIMNZsj1VhJRWeGMsFmczU6uCOMHd64lrCQ/s/d+uw0vWf+MPuea5Vp5DJ0gOPM7K4Ci7CerPVKhipJ/moqgJJ//8ipxN92NFdmmLbSip45pLmUunOH1Gjrc7ezGKnRfpB4wJO0ZpvkdbJGpyRfmufm+Y4Mxo1oK16n9UwNxOUHwaK3iQ==)\n\n### Using Transitions and Animations Together\n\nVue needs to attach event listeners in order to know when a transition has ended. It can either be `transitionend` or `animationend`, depending on the type of CSS rules applied. If you are only using one or the other, Vue can automatically detect the correct type.\n\nHowever, in some cases you may want to have both on the same element, for example having a CSS animation triggered by Vue, along with a CSS transition effect on hover. In these cases, you will have to explicitly declare the type you want Vue to care about by passing the `type` prop, with a value of either `animation` or `transition`:\n\n``` template\n<Transition type=\"animation\">...</Transition>\n```\n\n### Nested Transitions and Explicit Transition Durations\n\nAlthough the transition classes are only applied to the direct child element in `<Transition>`, we can transition nested elements using nested CSS selectors:\n\n``` template\n<Transition name=\"nested\">\n  <div v-if=\"show\" class=\"outer\">\n    <div class=\"inner\">\n      Hello\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n``` css\n/* rules that target nested elements */\n.nested-enter-active .inner,\n.nested-leave-active .inner {\n  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.nested-enter-from .inner,\n.nested-leave-to .inner {\n  transform: translateX(30px);\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n\n/* ... other necessary CSS omitted */\n```\n\nWe can even add a transition delay to the nested element on enter, which creates a staggered enter animation sequence:\n\n``` css\n/* delay enter of nested element for staggered effect */\n.nested-enter-active .inner {\n  transition-delay: 0.25s;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this creates a small issue. By default, the `<Transition>` component attempts to automatically figure out when the transition has finished by listening to the **first** `transitionend` or `animationend` event on the root transition element. With a nested transition, the desired behavior should be waiting until the transitions of all inner elements have finished.\n\nIn such cases you can specify an explicit transition duration (in milliseconds) using the `duration` prop on the `<transition>` component. The total duration should match the delay plus transition duration of the inner element:\n\n``` template\n<Transition :duration=\"550\">...</Transition>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\nIf necessary, you can also specify separate values for enter and leave durations using an object:\n\n``` template\n<Transition :duration=\"{ enter: 500, leave: 800 }\">...</Transition>\n```\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\nYou may notice that the animations shown above are mostly using properties like `transform` and `opacity`. These properties are efficient to animate because:\n\n1.  They do not affect the document layout during the animation, so they do not trigger expensive CSS layout calculation on every animation frame.\n\n2.  Most modern browsers can leverage GPU hardware acceleration when animating `transform`.\n\nIn comparison, properties like `height` or `margin` will trigger CSS layout, so they are much more expensive to animate, and should be used with caution. We can check resources like [CSS-Triggers](https://csstriggers.com/) to see which properties will trigger layout if we animate them.\n\n## JavaScript Hooks\n\nYou can hook into the transition process with JavaScript by listening to events on the `<Transition>` component:\n\n``` html\n<Transition\n  @before-enter=\"onBeforeEnter\"\n  @enter=\"onEnter\"\n  @after-enter=\"onAfterEnter\"\n  @enter-cancelled=\"onEnterCancelled\"\n  @before-leave=\"onBeforeLeave\"\n  @leave=\"onLeave\"\n  @after-leave=\"onAfterLeave\"\n  @leave-cancelled=\"onLeaveCancelled\"\n>\n  <!-- ... -->\n</Transition>\n```\n\n``` js\n// called before the element is inserted into the DOM.\n// use this to set the \"enter-from\" state of the element\nfunction onBeforeEnter(el) {}\n\n// called one frame after the element is inserted.\n// use this to start the entering animation.\nfunction onEnter(el, done) {\n  // call the done callback to indicate transition end\n  // optional if used in combination with CSS\n  done()\n}\n\n// called when the enter transition has finished.\nfunction onAfterEnter(el) {}\n\n// called when the enter transition is cancelled before completion.\nfunction onEnterCancelled(el) {}\n\n// called before the leave hook.\n// Most of the time, you should just use the leave hook\nfunction onBeforeLeave(el) {}\n\n// called when the leave transition starts.\n// use this to start the leaving animation.\nfunction onLeave(el, done) {\n  // call the done callback to indicate transition end\n  // optional if used in combination with CSS\n  done()\n}\n\n// called when the leave transition has finished and the\n// element has been removed from the DOM.\nfunction onAfterLeave(el) {}\n\n// only available with v-show transitions\nfunction onLeaveCancelled(el) {}\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  methods: {\n    // called before the element is inserted into the DOM.\n    // use this to set the \"enter-from\" state of the element\n    onBeforeEnter(el) {},\n\n    // called one frame after the element is inserted.\n    // use this to start the animation.\n    onEnter(el, done) {\n      // call the done callback to indicate transition end\n      // optional if used in combination with CSS\n      done()\n    },\n\n    // called when the enter transition has finished.\n    onAfterEnter(el) {},\n    onEnterCancelled(el) {},\n\n    // called before the leave hook.\n    // Most of the time, you should just use the leave hook.\n    onBeforeLeave(el) {},\n\n    // called when the leave transition starts.\n    // use this to start the leaving animation.\n    onLeave(el, done) {\n      // call the done callback to indicate transition end\n      // optional if used in combination with CSS\n      done()\n    },\n\n    // called when the leave transition has finished and the\n    // element has been removed from the DOM.\n    onAfterLeave(el) {},\n\n    // only available with v-show transitions\n    onLeaveCancelled(el) {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese hooks can be used in combination with CSS transitions / animations or on their own.\n\nWhen using JavaScript-only transitions, it is usually a good idea to add the `:css=\"false\"` prop. This explicitly tells Vue to skip auto CSS transition detection. Aside from being slightly more performant, this also prevents CSS rules from accidentally interfering with the transition:\n\n``` template\n<Transition\n  ...\n  :css=\"false\"\n>\n  ...\n</Transition>\n```\n\nWith `:css=\"false\"`, we are also fully responsible for controlling when the transition ends. In this case, the `done` callbacks are required for the `@enter` and `@leave` hooks. Otherwise, the hooks will be called synchronously and the transition will finish immediately.\n\nHere's a demo using the [GreenSock library](https://greensock.com/) to perform the animations. You can, of course, use any other animation library you want, for example [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) or [Motion One](https://motion.dev/).\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n## Reusable Transitions\n\nTransitions can be reused through Vue's component system. To create a reusable transition, we can create a component that wraps the `<Transition>` component and passes down the slot content:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- MyTransition.vue -->\n<script>\n// JavaScript hooks logic...\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- wrap the built-in Transition component -->\n  <Transition\n    name=\"my-transition\"\n    @enter=\"onEnter\"\n    @leave=\"onLeave\">\n    <slot></slot> <!-- pass down slot content -->\n  </Transition>\n</template>\n\n<style>\n/*\n  Necessary CSS...\n  Note: avoid using <style scoped> here since it\n  does not apply to slot content.\n*/\n</style>\n```\n\nNow `MyTransition` can be imported and used just like the built-in version:\n\n``` template\n<MyTransition>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Hello</div>\n</MyTransition>\n```\n\n## Transition on Appear\n\nIf you also want to apply a transition on the initial render of a node, you can add the `appear` prop:\n\n``` template\n<Transition appear>\n  ...\n</Transition>\n```\n\n## Transition Between Elements\n\nIn addition to toggling an element with `v-if` / `v-show`, we can also transition between two elements using `v-if` / `v-else` / `v-else-if`, as long as we make sure that there is only one element being shown at any given moment:\n\n``` template\n<Transition>\n  <button v-if=\"docState === 'saved'\">Edit</button>\n  <button v-else-if=\"docState === 'edited'\">Save</button>\n  <button v-else-if=\"docState === 'editing'\">Cancel</button>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n## Transition Modes\n\nIn the previous example, the entering and leaving elements are animated at the same time, and we had to make them `position: absolute` to avoid the layout issue when both elements are present in the DOM.\n\nHowever, in some cases this isn't an option, or simply isn't the desired behavior. We may want the leaving element to be animated out first, and for the entering element to only be inserted **after** the leaving animation has finished. Orchestrating such animations manually would be very complicated - luckily, we can enable this behavior by passing `<Transition>` a `mode` prop:\n\n``` template\n<Transition mode=\"out-in\">\n  ...\n</Transition>\n```\n\nHere's the previous demo with `mode=\"out-in\"`:\n\n`<Transition>` also supports `mode=\"in-out\"`, although it's much less frequently used.\n\n## Transition Between Components\n\n`<Transition>` can also be used around [dynamic components](../essentials/component-basics#dynamic-components):\n\n``` template\n<Transition name=\"fade\" mode=\"out-in\">\n  <component :is=\"activeComponent\"></component>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqtks9ugzAMxl/F4tJNamGXXVhWqewVduSSgStFCkkUDFpV9d0XJyn9t8MOkxBg5/Pvi+Mci51z5TxhURdi7LxytG2NGpz1BB92cDvYezvAqqxixNLVjaC5ETRZ0Br8jpIe93LSBMfWAHRBYQ0aGms4Jvw6Q05rFvSS5NNzEgN4pMmbcwQgO1Izsj5CalhFRLDj1RN/wis8olpaCQHh4LQk5IiEll+owy+XCGXcREAHh+9t4WWvbFvAvBlsjzpk7gx5TeqJtdG4LbawY5KoLtR/NGjYoHkw+PTSjIqUNWDkwOK97DHUMjVEdqKNMqE272E5dajV+JvpVlSLJllUF4+QENX1ERox0kHzb8m+m1CEfpOgYYgpqVHOmJNpgLQQa7BOdooO8FK+joByxLc4tlsiX6s7HtnEyvU1vKTCMO+4pWKdBnO+0FfbDk31as5HsvR+Hl9auuozk+J1/hspz+mRdPoBYtonzg==)\n\n## Dynamic Transitions\n\n`<Transition>` props like `name` can also be dynamic! It allows us to dynamically apply different transitions based on state change:\n\n``` template\n<Transition :name=\"transitionName\">\n  <!-- ... -->\n</Transition>\n```\n\nThis can be useful when you've defined CSS transitions / animations using Vue's transition class conventions and want to switch between them.\n\nYou can also apply different behavior in JavaScript transition hooks based on the current state of your component. Finally, the ultimate way of creating dynamic transitions is through [reusable transition components](#reusable-transitions) that accept props to change the nature of the transition(s) to be used. It may sound cheesy, but the only limit really is your imagination.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Related**\n\n- [`<Transition>` API reference](../../api/built-in-components#transition)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition)"

  id: guide/built-ins/transition-group
  summary: <TransitionGroup> is a built-in component designed for animating the insertion, removal, and order change of elements or components that are rendered in a list
  description: "# TransitionGroup\n\n`<TransitionGroup>` is a built-in component designed for animating the insertion, removal, and order change of elements or components that are rendered in a list.\n\n## Differences from `<Transition>`\n\n`<TransitionGroup>` supports the same props, CSS transition classes, and JavaScript hook listeners as `<Transition>`, with the following differences:\n\n- By default, it doesn't render a wrapper element. But you can specify an element to be rendered with the `tag` prop.\n\n- [Transition modes](transition#transition-modes) are not available, because we are no longer alternating between mutually exclusive elements.\n\n- Elements inside are **always required** to have a unique `key` attribute.\n\n- CSS transition classes will be applied to individual elements in the list, **not** to the group / container itself.\n\n**TIP**\n\nWhen used in [in-DOM templates](../essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats), it should be referenced as `<transition-group>`.\n\n## Enter / Leave Transitions\n\nHere is an example of applying enter / leave transitions to a `v-for` list using `<TransitionGroup>`:\n\n``` template\n<TransitionGroup name=\"list\" tag=\"ul\">\n  <li v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item\">\n    {{ item }}\n  </li>\n</TransitionGroup>\n```\n\n``` css\n.list-enter-active,\n.list-leave-active {\n  transition: all 0.5s ease;\n}\n.list-enter-from,\n.list-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translateX(30px);\n}\n```\n\n## Move Transitions\n\nThe above demo has some obvious flaws: when an item is inserted or removed, its surrounding items instantly \"jump\" into place instead of moving smoothly. We can fix this by adding a few additional CSS rules:\n\n``` css\n.list-move, /* apply transition to moving elements */\n.list-enter-active,\n.list-leave-active {\n  transition: all 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.list-enter-from,\n.list-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translateX(30px);\n}\n\n/* ensure leaving items are taken out of layout flow so that moving\n   animations can be calculated correctly. */\n.list-leave-active {\n  position: absolute;\n}\n```\n\nNow it looks much better - even animating smoothly when the whole list is shuffled:\n\n[Full Example](https://vuejs.org/examples/#list-transition)\n\n## Staggering List Transitions\n\nBy communicating with JavaScript transitions through data attributes, it's also possible to stagger transitions in a list. First, we render the index of an item as a data attribute on the DOM element:\n\n``` template\n<TransitionGroup\n  tag=\"ul\"\n  :css=\"false\"\n  @before-enter=\"onBeforeEnter\"\n  @enter=\"onEnter\"\n  @leave=\"onLeave\"\n>\n  <li\n    v-for=\"(item, index) in computedList\"\n    :key=\"item.msg\"\n    :data-index=\"index\"\n  >\n    {{ item.msg }}\n  </li>\n</TransitionGroup>\n```\n\nThen, in JavaScript hooks, we animate the element with a delay based on the data attribute. This example is using the [GreenSock library](https://greensock.com/) to perform the animation:\n\n``` js\nfunction onEnter(el, done) {\n  gsap.to(el, {\n    opacity: 1,\n    height: '1.6em',\n    delay: el.dataset.index * 0.15,\n    onComplete: done\n  })\n}\n```\n\n[Full Example in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n[Full Example in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Related**\n\n- [`<TransitionGroup>` API reference](../../api/built-in-components#transitiongroup)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition-group](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition-group)"

  id: guide/built-ins/keep-alive
  summary: <KeepAlive> is a built-in component that allows us to conditionally cache component instances when dynamically switching between multiple components
  description: "# KeepAlive\n\n`<KeepAlive>` is a built-in component that allows us to conditionally cache component instances when dynamically switching between multiple components.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn the Component Basics chapter, we introduced the syntax for [Dynamic Components](../essentials/component-basics#dynamic-components), using the `<component>` special element:\n\n``` template\n<component :is=\"activeComponent\" />\n```\n\nBy default, an active component instance will be unmounted when switching away from it. This will cause any changed state it holds to be lost. When this component is displayed again, a new instance will be created with only the initial state.\n\nIn the example below, we have two stateful components - A contains a counter, while B contains a message synced with an input via `v-model`. Try updating the state of one of them, switch away, and then switch back to it:\n\nYou'll notice that when switched back, the previous changed state would have been reset.\n\nCreating fresh component instance on switch is normally useful behavior, but in this case, we'd really like the two component instances to be preserved even when they are inactive. To solve this problem, we can wrap our dynamic component with the `<KeepAlive>` built-in component:\n\n``` template\n<!-- Inactive components will be cached! -->\n<KeepAlive>\n  <component :is=\"activeComponent\" />\n</KeepAlive>\n```\n\nNow, the state will be persisted across component switches:\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqtUsFOwzAM/RWrl4IGC+cqq2h3RFw495K12YhIk6hJi1DVf8dJSllBaAJxi+2XZz8/j0lhzHboeZIl1NadMA4sd73JKyVaozsHI9hnJqV+feJHmODY6RZS/JEuiL1uTTEXtiREnnINKFeAcgZUqtbKOqj7ruPKwe6s2VVguq4UJXEynAkDx1sjmeMYAdBGDFBLZu2uShre6ioJeaxIduAyp0KZ3oF7MxwRHWsEQmC4bXXDJWbmxpjLBiZ7DwptMUFyKCiJNP/BWUbO8gvnA+emkGKIgkKqRrRWfh+Z8MIWwpySpfbxn6wJKMGV4IuSs0UlN1HVJae7bxYvBuk+2IOIq7sLnph8P9u5DJv5VfpWWLaGqTzwZTCOM/M0IaMvBMihd04ruK+lqF/8Ajxms8EFbCiJxR8khsP6ncQosLWnWV6a/kUf2nqu75Fby04chA0iPftaYryhz6NBRLjdtajpHZTWPio=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqtU8tugzAQ/JUVl7RKWveMXFTIseofcHHAiawasPxArRD/3rVNSEhbpVUrIWB3x7PM7jAkuVL3veNJmlBTaaFsVraiUZ22sO0alcNedw2s7kmIPHS1ABQLQDEBAMqWvwVQzffMSQuDz1aI6VreWpPCEBtsJppx4wE1s+zmNoIBNLdOt8cIjzut8XAKq3A0NAIY/QNveFEyi8DA8kZJZjlGALQWPVSSGfNYJjVvujIJeaxItuMyo6JVzoJ9VxwRmtUCIdDfNV3NJWam5j7HpPOY8BEYkwxySiLLP1AWkbK4oHzmXOVS9FFOSM3jhFR4WTNfRslcO54nSwJKcCD4RsnZmJJNFPXJEl8t88quOuc39fCrHalsGyWcnJL62apYNoq12UQ8DLEFjCMy+kKA7Jy1XQtPlRTVqx+Jx6zXOJI1JbH4jejg3T+KbswBzXnFlz9Tjes/V/3CjWEHDsL/OYNvdCE8Wu3kLUQEhy+ljh+brFFu)\n\n**TIP**\n\nWhen used in [in-DOM templates](../essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats), it should be referenced as `<keep-alive>`.\n\n## Include / Exclude\n\nBy default, `<KeepAlive>` will cache any component instance inside. We can customize this behavior via the `include` and `exclude` props. Both props can be a comma-delimited string, a `RegExp`, or an array containing either types:\n\n``` template\n<!-- comma-delimited string -->\n<KeepAlive include=\"a,b\">\n  <component :is=\"view\" />\n</KeepAlive>\n\n<!-- regex (use `v-bind`) -->\n<KeepAlive :include=\"/a|b/\">\n  <component :is=\"view\" />\n</KeepAlive>\n\n<!-- Array (use `v-bind`) -->\n<KeepAlive :include=\"['a', 'b']\">\n  <component :is=\"view\" />\n</KeepAlive>\n```\n\nThe match is checked against the component's [`name`](../../api/options-misc#name) option, so components that need to be conditionally cached by `KeepAlive` must explicitly declare a `name` option.\n\n**TIP**\n\nSince version 3.2.34, a single-file component using `<script setup>` will automatically infer its `name` option based on the filename, removing the need to manually declare the name.\n\n## Max Cached Instances\n\nWe can limit the maximum number of component instances that can be cached via the `max` prop. When `max` is specified, `<KeepAlive>` behaves like an [LRU cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)): if the number of cached instances is about to exceed the specified max count, the least recently accessed cached instance will be destroyed to make room for the new one.\n\n``` template\n<KeepAlive :max=\"10\">\n  <component :is=\"activeComponent\" />\n</KeepAlive>\n```\n\n## Lifecycle of Cached Instance\n\nWhen a component instance is removed from the DOM but is part of a component tree cached by `<KeepAlive>`, it goes into a **deactivated** state instead of being unmounted. When a component instance is inserted into the DOM as part of a cached tree, it is **activated**.\n\nA kept-alive component can register lifecycle hooks for these two states using [`onActivated()`](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onactivated) and [`onDeactivated()`](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#ondeactivated):\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { onActivated, onDeactivated } from 'vue'\n\nonActivated(() => {\n  // called on initial mount\n  // and every time it is re-inserted from the cache\n})\n\nonDeactivated(() => {\n  // called when removed from the DOM into the cache\n  // and also when unmounted\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nA kept-alive component can register lifecycle hooks for these two states using [`activated`](../../api/options-lifecycle#activated) and [`deactivated`](../../api/options-lifecycle#deactivated) hooks:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  activated() {\n    // called on initial mount\n    // and every time it is re-inserted from the cache\n  },\n  deactivated() {\n    // called when removed from the DOM into the cache\n    // and also when unmounted\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that:\n\n- `onActivated``activated` is also called on mount, and `onDeactivated``deactivated` on unmount.\n\n- Both hooks work for not only the root component cached by `<KeepAlive>`, but also descendant components in the cached tree.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Related**\n\n- [`<KeepAlive>` API reference](../../api/built-in-components#keepalive)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/keep-alive](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/keep-alive)"

  id: guide/built-ins/teleport
  summary: <Teleport> is a built-in component that allows us to "teleport" a part of a component's template into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of that component
  description: "# Teleport\n\n`<Teleport>` is a built-in component that allows us to \"teleport\" a part of a component's template into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of that component.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nSometimes we may run into the following scenario: a part of a component's template belongs to it logically, but from a visual standpoint, it should be displayed somewhere else in the DOM, outside of the Vue application.\n\nThe most common example of this is when building a full-screen modal. Ideally, we want the modal's button and the modal itself to live within the same component, since they are both related to the open / close state of the modal. But that means the modal will be rendered alongside the button, deeply nested in the application's DOM hierarchy. This can create some tricky issues when positioning the modal via CSS.\n\nConsider the following HTML structure.\n\n``` template\n<div class=\"outer\">\n  <h3>Vue Teleport Example</h3>\n  <div>\n    <MyModal />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nAnd here is the implementation of `<MyModal>`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst open = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"open = true\">Open Modal</button>\n\n  <div v-if=\"open\" class=\"modal\">\n    <p>Hello from the modal!</p>\n    <button @click=\"open = false\">Close</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n.modal {\n  position: fixed;\n  z-index: 999;\n  top: 20%;\n  left: 50%;\n  width: 300px;\n  margin-left: -150px;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      open: false\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"open = true\">Open Modal</button>\n\n  <div v-if=\"open\" class=\"modal\">\n    <p>Hello from the modal!</p>\n    <button @click=\"open = false\">Close</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n.modal {\n  position: fixed;\n  z-index: 999;\n  top: 20%;\n  left: 50%;\n  width: 300px;\n  margin-left: -150px;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThe component contains a `<button>` to trigger the opening of the modal, and a `<div>` with a class of `.modal`, which will contain the modal's content and a button to self-close.\n\nWhen using this component inside the initial HTML structure, there are a number of potential issues:\n\n- `position: fixed` only places the element relative to the viewport when no ancestor element has `transform`, `perspective` or `filter` property set. If, for example, we intend to animate the ancestor `<div class=\"outer\">` with a CSS transform, it would break the modal layout!\n\n- The modal's `z-index` is constrained by its containing elements. If there is another element that overlaps with `<div class=\"outer\">` and has a higher `z-index`, it would cover our modal.\n\n`<Teleport>` provides a clean way to work around these, by allowing us to break out of the nested DOM structure. Let's modify `<MyModal>` to use `<Teleport>`:\n\n``` template\n<button @click=\"open = true\">Open Modal</button>\n\n<Teleport to=\"body\">\n  <div v-if=\"open\" class=\"modal\">\n    <p>Hello from the modal!</p>\n    <button @click=\"open = false\">Close</button>\n  </div>\n</Teleport>\n```\n\nThe `to` target of `<Teleport>` expects a CSS selector string or an actual DOM node. Here, we are essentially telling Vue to \"**teleport** this template fragment **to** the **`body`** tag\".\n\nYou can click the button below and inspect the `<body>` tag via your browser's devtools:\n\nYou can combine `<Teleport>` with [`<Transition>`](transition) to create animated modals - see [Example here](https://vuejs.org/examples/#modal).\n\n**TIP**\n\nThe teleport `to` target must be already in the DOM when the `<Teleport>` component is mounted. Ideally, this should be an element outside the entire Vue application. If targeting another element rendered by Vue, you need to make sure that element is mounted before the `<Teleport>`.\n\n## Using with Components\n\n`<Teleport>` only alters the rendered DOM structure - it does not affect the logical hierarchy of the components. That is to say, if `<Teleport>` contains a component, that component will remain a logical child of the parent component containing the `<Teleport>`. Props passing and event emitting will continue to work the same way.\n\nThis also means that injections from a parent component work as expected, and that the child component will be nested below the parent component in the Vue Devtools, instead of being placed where the actual content moved to.\n\n## Disabling Teleport\n\nIn some cases, we may want to conditionally disable `<Teleport>`. For example, we may want to render a component as an overlay for desktop, but inline on mobile. `<Teleport>` supports the `disabled` prop which can be dynamically toggled:\n\n``` template\n<Teleport :disabled=\"isMobile\">\n  ...\n</Teleport>\n```\n\nWhere the `isMobile` state can be dynamically updated by detecting media query changes.\n\n## Multiple Teleports on the Same Target\n\nA common use case would be a reusable `<Modal>` component, with the potential for multiple instances to be active at the same time. For this kind of scenario, multiple `<Teleport>` components can mount their content to the same target element. The order will be a simple append - later mounts will be located after earlier ones within the target element.\n\nGiven the following usage:\n\n``` template\n<Teleport to=\"#modals\">\n  <div>A</div>\n</Teleport>\n<Teleport to=\"#modals\">\n  <div>B</div>\n</Teleport>\n```\n\nThe rendered result would be:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"modals\">\n  <div>A</div>\n  <div>B</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Related**\n\n- [`<Teleport>` API reference](../../api/built-in-components#teleport)\n- [Handling Teleports in SSR](../scaling-up/ssr#teleports)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/teleport](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/teleport)"
- name: 31. Suspense  (Built-in Components)
  id: guide/built-ins/suspense
  summary: <Suspense> is an experimental feature
  description: "# Suspense\n\n**Experimental Feature**\n\n`<Suspense>` is an experimental feature. It is not guaranteed to reach stable status and the API may change before it does.\n\n`<Suspense>` is a built-in component for orchestrating async dependencies in a component tree. It can render a loading state while waiting for multiple nested async dependencies down the component tree to be resolved.\n\n## Async Dependencies\n\nTo explain the problem `<Suspense>` is trying to solve and how it interacts with these async dependencies, let's imagine a component hierarchy like the following:\n\n``` \n<Suspense>\n└─ <Dashboard>\n   ├─ <Profile>\n   │  └─ <FriendStatus> (component with async setup())\n   └─ <Content>\n      ├─ <ActivityFeed> (async component)\n      └─ <Stats> (async component)\n```\n\nIn the component tree there are multiple nested components whose rendering depends on some async resource to be resolved first. Without `<Suspense>`, each of them will need to handle its own loading / error and loaded states. In the worst case scenario, we may see three loading spinners on the page, with content displayed at different times.\n\nThe `<Suspense>` component gives us the ability to display top-level loading / error states while we wait on these nested async dependencies to be resolved.\n\nThere are two types of async dependencies that `<Suspense>` can wait on:\n\n1.  Components with an async `setup()` hook. This includes components using `<script setup>` with top-level `await` expressions.\n\n2.  [Async Components](../components/async).\n\n### `async setup()`\n\nA Composition API component's `setup()` hook can be async:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  async setup() {\n    const res = await fetch(...)\n    const posts = await res.json()\n    return {\n      posts\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf using `<script setup>`, the presence of top-level `await` expressions automatically makes the component an async dependency:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst res = await fetch(...)\nconst posts = await res.json()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  {{ posts }}\n</template>\n```\n\n### Async Components\n\nAsync components are **\"suspensible\"** by default. This means that if it has a `<Suspense>` in the parent chain, it will be treated as an async dependency of that `<Suspense>`. In this case, the loading state will be controlled by the `<Suspense>`, and the component's own loading, error, delay and timeout options will be ignored.\n\nThe async component can opt-out of `Suspense` control and let the component always control its own loading state by specifying `suspensible: false` in its options.\n\n## Loading State\n\nThe `<Suspense>` component has two slots: `#default` and `#fallback`. Both slots only allow for **one** immediate child node. The node in the default slot is shown if possible. If not, the node in the fallback slot will be shown instead.\n\n``` template\n<Suspense>\n  <!-- component with nested async dependencies -->\n  <Dashboard />\n\n  <!-- loading state via #fallback slot -->\n  <template #fallback>\n    Loading...\n  </template>\n</Suspense>\n```\n\nOn initial render, `<Suspense>` will render its default slot content in memory. If any async dependencies are encountered during the process, it will enter a **pending** state. During the pending state, the fallback content will be displayed. When all encountered async dependencies have been resolved, `<Suspense>` enters a **resolved** state and the resolved default slot content is displayed.\n\nIf no async dependencies were encountered during the initial render, `<Suspense>` will directly go into a resolved state.\n\nOnce in a resolved state, `<Suspense>` will only revert to a pending state if the root node of the `#default` slot is replaced. New async dependencies nested deeper in the tree will **not** cause the `<Suspense>` to revert to a pending state.\n\nWhen a revert happens, fallback content will not be immediately displayed. Instead, `<Suspense>` will display the previous `#default` content while waiting for the new content and its async dependencies to be resolved. This behavior can be configured with the `timeout` prop: `<Suspense>` will switch to fallback content if it takes longer than `timeout` to render the new default content. A `timeout` value of `0` will cause the fallback content to be displayed immediately when default content is replaced.\n\n## Events\n\nThe `<Suspense>` component emits 3 events: `pending`, `resolve` and `fallback`. The `pending` event occurs when entering a pending state. The `resolve` event is emitted when new content has finished resolving in the `default` slot. The `fallback` event is fired when the contents of the `fallback` slot are shown.\n\nThe events could be used, for example, to show a loading indicator in front of the old DOM while new components are loading.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n`<Suspense>` currently does not provide error handling via the component itself - however, you can use the [`errorCaptured`](../../api/options-lifecycle#errorcaptured) option or the [`onErrorCaptured()`](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onerrorcaptured) hook to capture and handle async errors in the parent component of `<Suspense>`.\n\n## Combining with Other Components\n\nIt is common to want to use `<Suspense>` in combination with the [`<Transition>`](transition) and [`<KeepAlive>`](keep-alive) components. The nesting order of these components is important to get them all working correctly.\n\nIn addition, these components are often used in conjunction with the `<RouterView>` component from [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).\n\nThe following example shows how to nest these components so that they all behave as expected. For simpler combinations you can remove the components that you don't need:\n\n``` template\n<RouterView v-slot=\"{ Component }\">\n  <template v-if=\"Component\">\n    <Transition mode=\"out-in\">\n      <KeepAlive>\n        <Suspense>\n          <!-- main content -->\n          <component :is=\"Component\"></component>\n\n          <!-- loading state -->\n          <template #fallback>\n            Loading...\n          </template>\n        </Suspense>\n      </KeepAlive>\n    </Transition>\n  </template>\n</RouterView>\n```\n\nVue Router has built-in support for [lazily loading components](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html) using dynamic imports. These are distinct from async components and currently they will not trigger `<Suspense>`. However, they can still have async components as descendants and those can trigger `<Suspense>` in the usual way.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense)"
- name: 32. Single-File Components  (Scaling Up)
  id: guide/scaling-up/sfc
  summary: Vue Single-File Components (a.k.a
  description: "# Single-File Components\n\n## Introduction\n\nVue Single-File Components (a.k.a. `*.vue` files, abbreviated as **SFC**) is a special file format that allows us to encapsulate the template, logic, **and** styling of a Vue component in a single file. Here's an example SFC:\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      greeting: 'Hello World!'\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <p class=\"greeting\">{{ greeting }}</p>\n</template>\n\n<style>\n.greeting {\n  color: red;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nconst greeting = ref('Hello World!')\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <p class=\"greeting\">{{ greeting }}</p>\n</template>\n\n<style>\n.greeting {\n  color: red;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nAs we can see, Vue SFC is a natural extension of the classic trio of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style>` blocks encapsulate and colocate the view, logic and styling of a component in the same file. The full syntax is defined in the [SFC Syntax Specification](../../api/sfc-spec).\n\n## Why SFC\n\nWhile SFCs require a build step, there are numerous benefits in return:\n\n- Author modularized components using familiar HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax\n- [Colocation of inherently coupled concerns](#what-about-separation-of-concerns)\n- Pre-compiled templates without runtime compilation cost\n- [Component-scoped CSS](../../api/sfc-css-features)\n- [More ergonomic syntax when working with Composition API](../../api/sfc-script-setup)\n- More compile-time optimizations by cross-analyzing template and script\n- [IDE support](tooling#ide-support) with auto-completion and type-checking for template expressions\n- Out-of-the-box Hot-Module Replacement (HMR) support\n\nSFC is a defining feature of Vue as a framework, and is the recommended approach for using Vue in the following scenarios:\n\n- Single-Page Applications (SPA)\n- Static Site Generation (SSG)\n- Any non-trivial frontend where a build step can be justified for better development experience (DX).\n\nThat said, we do realize there are scenarios where SFCs can feel like overkill. This is why Vue can still be used via plain JavaScript without a build step. If you are just looking for enhancing largely static HTML with light interactions, you can also check out [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue), a 6 kB subset of Vue optimized for progressive enhancement.\n\n## How It Works\n\nVue SFC is a framework-specific file format and must be pre-compiled by [@vue/compiler-sfc](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/compiler-sfc) into standard JavaScript and CSS. A compiled SFC is a standard JavaScript (ES) module - which means with proper build setup you can import an SFC like a module:\n\n``` js\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    MyComponent\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`<style>` tags inside SFCs are typically injected as native `<style>` tags during development to support hot updates. For production they can be extracted and merged into a single CSS file.\n\nYou can play with SFCs and explore how they are compiled in the [Vue SFC Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/).\n\nIn actual projects, we typically integrate the SFC compiler with a build tool such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Vue CLI](http://cli.vuejs.org/) (which is based on [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)), and Vue provides official scaffolding tools to get you started with SFCs as fast as possible. Check out more details in the [SFC Tooling](tooling) section.\n\n## What About Separation of Concerns?\n\nSome users coming from a traditional web development background may have the concern that SFCs are mixing different concerns in the same place - which HTML/CSS/JS were supposed to separate!\n\nTo answer this question, it is important for us to agree that **separation of concerns is not equal to the separation of file types**. The ultimate goal of engineering principles is to improve the maintainability of codebases. Separation of concerns, when applied dogmatically as separation of file types, does not help us reach that goal in the context of increasingly complex frontend applications.\n\nIn modern UI development, we have found that instead of dividing the codebase into three huge layers that interweave with one another, it makes much more sense to divide them into loosely-coupled components and compose them. Inside a component, its template, logic, and styles are inherently coupled, and colocating them actually makes the component more cohesive and maintainable.\n\nNote even if you don't like the idea of Single-File Components, you can still leverage its hot-reloading and pre-compilation features by separating your JavaScript and CSS into separate files using [Src Imports](../../api/sfc-spec#src-imports).\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc)"

  summary: It is also recommended to use these online playgrounds to provide reproductions when reporting bugs
  description: "# Tooling\n\n## Try It Online\n\nYou don't need to install anything on your machine to try out Vue SFCs - there are online playgrounds that allow you to do so right in the browser:\n\n- [Vue SFC Playground](https://play.vuejs.org)\n  - Always deployed from latest commit\n  - Designed for inspecting component compilation results\n- [Vue + Vite on StackBlitz](https://vite.new/vue)\n  - IDE-like environment running actual Vite dev server in the browser\n  - Closest to local setup\n\nIt is also recommended to use these online playgrounds to provide reproductions when reporting bugs.\n\n## Project Scaffolding\n\n### Vite\n\n[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a lightweight and fast build tool with first-class Vue SFC support. It is created by Evan You, who is also the author of Vue!\n\nTo get started with Vite + Vue, simply run:\n\n``` sh\n$ npm create vue@latest\n```\n\nThis command will install and execute [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), the official Vue project scaffolding tool.\n\n- To learn more about Vite, check out the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev).\n- To configure Vue-specific behavior in a Vite project, for example passing options to the Vue compiler, check out the docs for [@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#readme).\n\nBoth online playgrounds mentioned above also support downloading files as a Vite project.\n\n### Vue CLI\n\n[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) is the official webpack-based toolchain for Vue. It is now in maintenance mode and we recommend starting new projects with Vite unless you rely on specific webpack-only features. Vite will provide superior developer experience in most cases.\n\nFor information on migrating from Vue CLI to Vite:\n\n- [Vue CLI -\\> Vite Migration Guide from VueSchool.io](https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/how-to-migrate-from-vue-cli-to-vite/)\n- [Tools / Plugins that help with auto migration](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#vue-cli)\n\n### Note on In-Browser Template Compilation\n\nWhen using Vue without a build step, component templates are written either directly in the page's HTML or as inlined JavaScript strings. In such cases, Vue needs to ship the template compiler to the browser in order to perform on-the-fly template compilation. On the other hand, the compiler would be unnecessary if we pre-compile the templates with a build step. To reduce client bundle size, Vue provides [different \"builds\"](https://unpkg.com/browse/vue@3/dist/) optimized for different use cases.\n\n- Build files that start with `vue.runtime.*` are **runtime-only builds**: they do not include the compiler. When using these builds, all templates must be pre-compiled via a build step.\n\n- Build files that do not include `.runtime` are **full builds**: they include the compiler and support compiling templates directly in the browser. However, they will increase the payload by ~14kb.\n\nOur default tooling setups use the runtime-only build since all templates in SFCs are pre-compiled. If, for some reason, you need in-browser template compilation even with a build step, you can do so by configuring the build tool to alias `vue` to `vue/dist/vue.esm-bundler.js` instead.\n\nIf you are looking for a lighter-weight alternative for no-build-step usage, check out [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue).\n\n## IDE Support\n\n- The recommended IDE setup is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + the [Vue Language Features (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension. The extension provides syntax highlighting, TypeScript support, and intellisense for template expressions and component props.\n\n  **TIP**\n  Volar replaces [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur), our previous official VSCode extension for Vue 2. If you have Vetur currently installed, make sure to disable it in Vue 3 projects.\n\n- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) also provides great built-in support for Vue SFCs.\n\n- Other IDEs that support the [Language Service Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) can also leverage Volar's core functionalities via LSP:\n\n  - Sublime Text support via [LSP-Volar](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-volar).\n\n  - vim / Neovim support via [coc-volar](https://github.com/yaegassy/coc-volar).\n\n  - emacs support via [lsp-mode](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-volar/)\n\n## Browser Devtools\n\nThe Vue browser devtools extension allows you to explore a Vue app's component tree, inspect the state of individual components, track state management events, and profile performance.\n\n- [Documentation](https://devtools.vuejs.org/)\n- [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)\n- [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/)\n- [Edge Extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/vuejs-devtools/olofadcdnkkjdfgjcmjaadnlehnnihnl)\n- [Standalone Electron app](https://devtools.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#standalone)\n\n## TypeScript\n\nMain article: [Using Vue with TypeScript](../typescript/overview).\n\n- [Volar](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar) provides type checking for SFCs using `<script lang=\"ts\">` blocks, including template expressions and cross-component props validation.\n\n- Use [`vue-tsc`](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc) for performing the same type checking from the command line, or for generating `d.ts` files for SFCs.\n\n## Testing\n\nMain article: [Testing Guide](testing).\n\n- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is recommended for E2E tests. It can also be used for component testing for Vue SFCs via the [Cypress Component Test Runner](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/introduction).\n\n- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a test runner created by Vue / Vite team members that focuses on speed. It is specifically designed for Vite-based applications to provide the same instant feedback loop for unit / component testing.\n\n- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) can be made to work with Vite via [vite-jest](https://github.com/sodatea/vite-jest). However, this is only recommended if you have existing Jest-based test suites that you need to migrate over to a Vite-based setup, as Vitest provides similar functionalities with a much more efficient integration.\n\n## Linting\n\nThe Vue team maintains [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue), an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin that supports SFC-specific linting rules.\n\nUsers previously using Vue CLI may be used to having linters configured via webpack loaders. However when using a Vite-based build setup, our general recommendation is:\n\n1.  `npm install -D eslint eslint-plugin-vue`, then follow `eslint-plugin-vue`'s [configuration guide](https://eslint.vuejs.org/user-guide/#usage).\n\n2.  Setup ESLint IDE extensions, for example [ESLint for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), so you get linter feedback right in your editor during development. This also avoids unnecessary linting cost when starting the dev server.\n\n3.  Run ESLint as part of the production build command, so you get full linter feedback before shipping to production.\n\n4.  (Optional) Setup tools like [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically lint modified files on git commit.\n\n## Formatting\n\n- The [Volar](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar) VSCode extension provides formatting for Vue SFCs out of the box.\n\n- Alternatively, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) provides built-in Vue SFC formatting support.\n\n## SFC Custom Block Integrations\n\nCustom blocks are compiled into imports to the same Vue file with different request queries. It is up to the underlying build tool to handle these import requests.\n\n- If using Vite, a custom Vite plugin should be used to transform matched custom blocks into executable JavaScript. [Example](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#example-for-transforming-custom-blocks)\n\n- If using Vue CLI or plain webpack, a webpack loader should be configured to transform the matched blocks. [Example](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/custom-blocks.html)\n\n## Lower-Level Packages\n\n### `@vue/compiler-sfc`\n\n- [Docs](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/compiler-sfc)\n\nThis package is part of the Vue core monorepo and is always published with the same version as the main `vue` package. It is included as a dependency of the main `vue` package and proxied under `vue/compiler-sfc` so you don't need to install it individually.\n\nThe package itself provides lower-level utilities for processing Vue SFCs and is only meant for tooling authors that need to support Vue SFCs in custom tools.\n\n**TIP**\n\nAlways prefer using this package via the `vue/compiler-sfc` deep import since this ensures its version is in sync with the Vue runtime.\n\n### `@vitejs/plugin-vue`\n\n- [Docs](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue)\n\nOfficial plugin that provides Vue SFC support in Vite.\n\n### `vue-loader`\n\n- [Docs](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/)\n\nThe official loader that provides Vue SFC support in webpack. If you are using Vue CLI, also see [docs on modifying `vue-loader` options in Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html#modifying-options-of-a-loader).\n\n## Other Online Playgrounds\n\n- [VueUse Playground](https://play.vueuse.org)\n- [Vue + Vite on Repl.it](https://replit.com/@templates/VueJS-with-Vite)\n- [Vue on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-3)\n- [Vue on Codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/editor/vue)\n- [Vue on Components.studio](https://components.studio/create/vue3)\n- [Vue on WebComponents.dev](https://webcomponents.dev/create/cevue)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling)"

  summary: Routing on the server side means the server sending a response based on the URL path that the user is visiting
  description: "# Routing\n\n## Client-Side vs. Server-Side Routing\n\nRouting on the server side means the server sending a response based on the URL path that the user is visiting. When we click on a link in a traditional server-rendered web app, the browser receives an HTML response from the server and reloads the entire page with the new HTML.\n\nIn a [Single-Page Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) (SPA), however, the client-side JavaScript can intercept the navigation, dynamically fetch new data, and update the current page without full page reloads. This typically results in a more snappy user experience, especially for use cases that are more like actual \"applications\", where the user is expected to perform many interactions over a long period of time.\n\nIn such SPAs, the \"routing\" is done on the client side, in the browser. A client-side router is responsible for managing the application's rendered view using browser APIs such as [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) or the [`hashchange` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event).\n\n## Official Router\n\nVue is well-suited for building SPAs. For most SPAs, it's recommended to use the officially-supported [Vue Router library](https://github.com/vuejs/router). For more details, see Vue Router's [documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/).\n\n## Simple Routing from Scratch\n\nIf you only need very simple routing and do not wish to involve a full-featured router library, you can do so with [Dynamic Components](../essentials/component-basics#dynamic-components) and update the current component state by listening to browser [`hashchange` events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event) or using the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History).\n\nHere's a bare-bone example:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\nimport Home from './Home.vue'\nimport About from './About.vue'\nimport NotFound from './NotFound.vue'\n\nconst routes = {\n  '/': Home,\n  '/about': About\n}\n\nconst currentPath = ref(window.location.hash)\n\nwindow.addEventListener('hashchange', () => {\n  currentPath.value = window.location.hash\n})\n\nconst currentView = computed(() => {\n  return routes[currentPath.value.slice(1) || '/'] || NotFound\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <a href=\"#/\">Home</a> |\n  <a href=\"#/about\">About</a> |\n  <a href=\"#/non-existent-path\">Broken Link</a>\n  <component :is=\"currentView\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nimport Home from './Home.vue'\nimport About from './About.vue'\nimport NotFound from './NotFound.vue'\n\nconst routes = {\n  '/': Home,\n  '/about': About\n}\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      currentPath: window.location.hash\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    currentView() {\n      return routes[this.currentPath.slice(1) || '/'] || NotFound\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    window.addEventListener('hashchange', () => {\n          this.currentPath = window.location.hash\n        })\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <a href=\"#/\">Home</a> |\n  <a href=\"#/about\">About</a> |\n  <a href=\"#/non-existent-path\">Broken Link</a>\n  <component :is=\"currentView\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/routing](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/routing)"

  summary: Technically, every Vue component instance already "manages" its own reactive state
  description: "# State Management\n\n## What is State Management?\n\nTechnically, every Vue component instance already \"manages\" its own reactive state. Take a simple counter component as an example:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\n// state\nconst count = ref(0)\n\n// actions\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}\n</script>\n\n<!-- view -->\n<template>{{ count }}</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  // state\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n  // actions\n  methods: {\n    increment() {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<!-- view -->\n<template>{{ count }}</template>\n```\n\nIt is a self-contained unit with the following parts:\n\n- The **state**, the source of truth that drives our app;\n- The **view**, a declarative mapping of the **state**;\n- The **actions**, the possible ways the state could change in reaction to user inputs from the **view**.\n\nThis is a simple representation of the concept of \"one-way data flow\":\n\nHowever, the simplicity starts to break down when we have **multiple components that share a common state**:\n\n1.  Multiple views may depend on the same piece of state.\n2.  Actions from different views may need to mutate the same piece of state.\n\nFor case one, a possible workaround is by \"lifting\" the shared state up to a common ancestor component, and then pass it down as props. However, this quickly gets tedious in component trees with deep hierarchies, leading to another problem known as [Prop Drilling](../components/provide-inject#prop-drilling).\n\nFor case two, we often find ourselves resorting to solutions such as reaching for direct parent / child instances via template refs, or trying to mutate and synchronize multiple copies of the state via emitted events. Both of these patterns are brittle and quickly lead to unmaintainable code.\n\nA simpler and more straightforward solution is to extract the shared state out of the components, and manage it in a global singleton. With this, our component tree becomes a big \"view\", and any component can access the state or trigger actions, no matter where they are in the tree!\n\n## Simple State Management with Reactivity API\n\nIn Options API, reactive data is declared using the `data()` option. Internally, the object returned by `data()` is made reactive via the [`reactive()`](../../api/reactivity-core#reactive) function, which is also available as a public API.\n\nIf you have a piece of state that should be shared by multiple instances, you can use [`reactive()`](../../api/reactivity-core#reactive) to create a reactive object, and then import it into multiple components:\n\n``` js\n// store.js\nimport { reactive } from 'vue'\n\nexport const store = reactive({\n  count: 0\n})\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- ComponentA.vue -->\n<script setup>\nimport { store } from './store.js'\n</script>\n\n<template>From A: {{ store.count }}</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- ComponentB.vue -->\n<script setup>\nimport { store } from './store.js'\n</script>\n\n<template>From B: {{ store.count }}</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- ComponentA.vue -->\n<script>\nimport { store } from './store.js'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      store\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>From A: {{ store.count }}</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- ComponentB.vue -->\n<script>\nimport { store } from './store.js'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      store\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>From B: {{ store.count }}</template>\n```\n\nNow whenever the `store` object is mutated, both `<ComponentA>` and `<ComponentB>` will update their views automatically - we have a single source of truth now.\n\nHowever, this also means any component importing `store` can mutate it however they want:\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"store.count++\">\n    From B: {{ store.count }}\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\nWhile this works in simple cases, global state that can be arbitrarily mutated by any component is not going to be very maintainable in the long run. To ensure the state-mutating logic is centralized like the state itself, it is recommended to define methods on the store with names that express the intention of the actions:\n\n``` js\n// store.js\nimport { reactive } from 'vue'\n\nexport const store = reactive({\n  count: 0,\n  increment() {\n    this.count++\n  }\n})\n```\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"store.increment()\">\n    From B: {{ store.count }}\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNrNkk1uwyAQha8yYpNEiUzXllPVrtRTeJNSqtLGgGBsVbK4ewdwnT9FWWSTFczwmPc+xMhqa4uhl6xklRdOWQQvsbfPrVadNQ7h1dCqpcYaPp3pYFHwQyteXVxKm0tpM0krnm3IgAqUnd3vUFIFUB1Z8bNOkzoVny+wDTuNcZ1gBI/GSQhzqlQX3/5Gng81pA1t33tEo+FF7JX42bYsT1BaONlRguWqZZMU4C261CWMk3EhTK8RQphm8Twse/BscoUsvdqDkTX3kP3nI6aZwcmdQDUcMPJPabX8TQphtCf0RLqd1csxuqQAJTxtYnEUGtIpAH4pn1Ou17FDScOKhT+QNAVM)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNrdU8FqhDAU/JVHLruyi+lZ3FIt9Cu82JilaTWR5CkF8d8bE5O1u1so9FYQzAyTvJnRTKTo+3QcOMlIbpgWPT5WUnS90gjPyr4ll1jAWasOdim9UMum3a20vJWWqxSgkvzTyRt+rocWYVpYFoQm8wRsJh+viHLBcyXtk9No2ALkXd/WyC0CyDfW6RVTOiancQM5ku+x7nUxgUGlOcwxn8Ppu7HJ7udqaqz3SYikOQ5aBgT+OA9slt9kasToFnb5OiAqCU+sFezjVBHvRUimeWdT7JOKrFKAl8VvYatdI6RMDRJhdlPtWdQf5mdQP+SHdtyX/IftlH9pJyS1vcQ2NK8ZivFSiL8BsQmmpMG1s1NU79frYA1k8OD+/I3pUA6+CeNdHg6hmoTMX9pPSnk=)\n\n**TIP**\n\nNote the click handler uses `store.increment()` with parentheses - this is necessary to call the method with the proper `this` context since it's not a component method.\n\nAlthough here we are using a single reactive object as a store, you can also share reactive state created using other [Reactivity APIs](../../api/reactivity-core) such as `ref()` or `computed()`, or even return global state from a [Composable](../reusability/composables):\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\n// global state, created in module scope\nconst globalCount = ref(1)\n\nexport function useCount() {\n  // local state, created per-component\n  const localCount = ref(1)\n\n  return {\n    globalCount,\n    localCount\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe fact that Vue's reactivity system is decoupled from the component model makes it extremely flexible.\n\n## SSR Considerations\n\nIf you are building an application that leverages [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](ssr), the above pattern can lead to issues due to the store being a singleton shared across multiple requests. This is discussed in [more details](ssr#cross-request-state-pollution) in the SSR guide.\n\n## Pinia\n\nWhile our hand-rolled state management solution will suffice in simple scenarios, there are many more things to consider in large-scale production applications:\n\n- Stronger conventions for team collaboration\n- Integrating with the Vue DevTools, including timeline, in-component inspection, and time-travel debugging\n- Hot Module Replacement\n- Server-Side Rendering support\n\n[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) is a state management library that implements all of the above. It is maintained by the Vue core team, and works with both Vue 2 and Vue 3.\n\nExisting users may be familiar with [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), the previous official state management library for Vue. With Pinia serving the same role in the ecosystem, Vuex is now in maintenance mode. It still works, but will no longer receive new features. It is recommended to use Pinia for new applications.\n\nPinia started out as an exploration of what the next iteration of Vuex could look like, incorporating many ideas from core team discussions for Vuex 5. Eventually, we realized that Pinia already implements most of what we wanted in Vuex 5, and decided to make it the new recommendation instead.\n\nCompared to Vuex, Pinia provides a simpler API with less ceremony, offers Composition-API-style APIs, and most importantly, has solid type inference support when used with TypeScript.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management)"

  summary: Automated tests help you and your team build complex Vue applications quickly and confidently by preventing regressions and encouraging you to break apart your application into testable functions, modules, classes, and components
  description: "# Testing\n\n## Why Test?\n\nAutomated tests help you and your team build complex Vue applications quickly and confidently by preventing regressions and encouraging you to break apart your application into testable functions, modules, classes, and components. As with any application, your new Vue app can break in many ways, and it's important that you can catch these issues and fix them before releasing.\n\nIn this guide, we'll cover basic terminology and provide our recommendations on which tools to choose for your Vue 3 application.\n\nThere is one Vue-specific section covering composables. See [Testing Composables](#testing-composables) below for more details.\n\n## When to Test\n\nStart testing early! We recommend you begin writing tests as soon as you can. The longer you wait to add tests to your application, the more dependencies your application will have, and the harder it will be to start.\n\n## Testing Types\n\nWhen designing your Vue application's testing strategy, you should leverage the following testing types:\n\n- **Unit**: Checks that inputs to a given function, class, or composable are producing the expected output or side effects.\n- **Component**: Checks that your component mounts, renders, can be interacted with, and behaves as expected. These tests import more code than unit tests, are more complex, and require more time to execute.\n- **End-to-end**: Checks features that span multiple pages and makes real network requests against your production-built Vue application. These tests often involve standing up a database or other backend.\n\nEach testing type plays a role in your application's testing strategy, and each will protect you against different types of issues.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe will briefly discuss what each of these are, how they can be implemented for Vue applications, and provide some general recommendations.\n\n## Unit Testing\n\nUnit tests are written to verify that small, isolated units of code are working as expected. A unit test usually covers a single function, class, composable, or module. Unit tests focus on logical correctness and only concern themselves with a small portion of the application's overall functionality. They may mock large parts of your application's environment (e.g. initial state, complex classes, 3rd party modules, and network requests).\n\nIn general, unit tests will catch issues with a function's business logic and logical correctness.\n\nTake for example this `increment` function:\n\n``` js\n// helpers.js\nexport function increment (current, max = 10) {\n  if (current < max) {\n    return current + 1\n  }\n  return current\n}\n```\n\nBecause it's very self-contained, it'll be easy to invoke the increment function and assert that it returns what it's supposed to, so we'll write a Unit Test.\n\nIf any of these assertions fail, it's clear that the issue is contained within the `increment` function.\n\n``` js\n// helpers.spec.js\nimport { increment } from './helpers'\n\ndescribe('increment', () => {\n  test('increments the current number by 1', () => {\n    expect(increment(0, 10)).toBe(1)\n  })\n\n  test('does not increment the current number over the max', () => {\n    expect(increment(10, 10)).toBe(10)\n  })\n\n  test('has a default max of 10', () => {\n    expect(increment(10)).toBe(10)\n  })\n})\n```\n\nAs mentioned previously, unit testing is typically applied to self-contained business logic, components, classes, modules, or functions that do not involve UI rendering, network requests, or other environmental concerns.\n\nThese are typically plain JavaScript / TypeScript modules unrelated to Vue. In general, writing unit tests for business logic in Vue applications does not differ significantly from applications using other frameworks.\n\nThere are two instances where you DO unit test Vue-specific features:\n\n1.  Composables\n2.  Components\n\n### Composables\n\nOne category of functions specific to Vue applications is [Composables](../reusability/composables), which may require special handling during tests. See [Testing Composables](#testing-composables) below for more details.\n\n### Unit Testing Components\n\nA component can be tested in two ways:\n\n1.  Whitebox: Unit Testing\n\n    Tests that are \"Whitebox tests\" are aware of the implementation details and dependencies of a component. They are focused on **isolating** the component under test. These tests will usually involve mocking some, if not all of your component's children, as well as setting up plugin state and dependencies (e.g. Pinia).\n\n2.  Blackbox: Component Testing\n\n    Tests that are \"Blackbox tests\" are unaware of the implementation details of a component. These tests mock as little as possible to test the integration of your component and the entire system. They usually render all child components and are considered more of an \"integration test\". See the [Component Testing recommendations](#component-testing) below.\n\n### Recommendation\n\n- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)\n\n  Since the official setup created by `create-vue` is based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), we recommend using a unit testing framework that can leverage the same configuration and transform pipeline directly from Vite. [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a unit testing framework designed specifically for this purpose, created and maintained by Vue / Vite team members. It integrates with Vite-based projects with minimal effort, and is blazing fast.\n\n### Other Options\n\n- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a popular unit testing framework. However, we only recommend Jest if you have an existing Jest test suite that needs to be migrated over to a Vite-based project, as Vitest offers a more seamless integration and better performance.\n\n## Component Testing\n\nIn Vue applications, components are the main building blocks of the UI. Components are therefore the natural unit of isolation when it comes to validating your application's behavior. From a granularity perspective, component testing sits somewhere above unit testing and can be considered a form of integration testing. Much of your Vue Application should be covered by a component test and we recommend that each Vue component has its own spec file.\n\nComponent tests should catch issues relating to your component's props, events, slots that it provides, styles, classes, lifecycle hooks, and more.\n\nComponent tests should not mock child components, but instead test the interactions between your component and its children by interacting with the components as a user would. For example, a component test should click on an element like a user would instead of programmatically interacting with the component.\n\nComponent tests should focus on the component's public interfaces rather than internal implementation details. For most components, the public interface is limited to: events emitted, props, and slots. When testing, remember to **test what a component does, not how it does it**.\n\n**DO**\n\n- For **Visual** logic: assert correct render output based on inputted props and slots.\n\n- For **Behavioral** logic: assert correct render updates or emitted events in response to user input events.\n\n  In the below example, we demonstrate a Stepper component that has a DOM element labeled \"increment\" and can be clicked. We pass a prop called `max` that prevents the Stepper from being incremented past `2`, so if we click the button 3 times, the UI should still say `2`.\n\n  We know nothing about the implementation of Stepper, only that the \"input\" is the `max` prop and the \"output\" is the state of the DOM as the user will see it.\n\nVue Test Utils\n\nCypress\n\nTesting Library\n\n``` js\nconst valueSelector = '[data-testid=stepper-value]'\nconst buttonSelector = '[data-testid=increment]'\n\nconst wrapper = mount(Stepper, {\n  props: {\n    max: 1\n  }\n})\n\nexpect(wrapper.find(valueSelector).text()).toContain('0')\n\nawait wrapper.find(buttonSelector).trigger('click')\n\nexpect(wrapper.find(valueSelector).text()).toContain('1')\n```\n\n``` js\nconst valueSelector = '[data-testid=stepper-value]'\nconst buttonSelector = '[data-testid=increment]'\n\nmount(Stepper, {\n  props: {\n    max: 1\n  }\n})\n\ncy.get(valueSelector).should('be.visible').and('contain.text', '0')\n  .get(buttonSelector).click()\n  .get(valueSelector).should('contain.text', '1')\n```\n\n``` js\nconst { getByText } = render(Stepper, {\n  props: {\n    max: 1\n  }\n})\n\ngetByText('0') // Implicit assertion that \"0\" is within the component\n\nconst button = getByRole('button', { name: /increment/i })\n\n// Dispatch a click event to our increment button.\nawait fireEvent.click(button)\n\ngetByText('1')\n\nawait fireEvent.click(button)\n```\n\n- **DON'T**\n\n  Don't assert the private state of a component instance or test the private methods of a component. Testing implementation details makes the tests brittle, as they are more likely to break and require updates when the implementation changes.\n\n  The component's ultimate job is rendering the correct DOM output, so tests focusing on the DOM output provide the same level of correctness assurance (if not more) while being more robust and resilient to change.\n\n  Don't rely exclusively on snapshot tests. Asserting HTML strings does not describe correctness. Write tests with intentionality.\n\n  If a method needs to be tested thoroughly, consider extracting it into a standalone utility function and write a dedicated unit test for it. If it cannot be extracted cleanly, it may be tested as a part of a component, integration, or end-to-end test that covers it.\n\n### Recommendation\n\n- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for components or composables that render headlessly (e.g. the [`useFavicon`](https://vueuse.org/core/useFavicon/#usefavicon) function in VueUse). Components and DOM can be tested using [`@vue/test-utils`](https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils).\n\n- [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component) for components whose expected behavior depends on properly rendering styles or triggering native DOM events. It can be used with Testing Library via [@testing-library/cypress](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro).\n\nThe main differences between Vitest and browser-based runners are speed and execution context. In short, browser-based runners, like Cypress, can catch issues that node-based runners, like Vitest, cannot (e.g. style issues, real native DOM events, cookies, local storage, and network failures), but browser-based runners are *orders of magnitude slower than Vitest* because they do open a browser, compile your stylesheets, and more. Cypress is a browser-based runner that supports component testing. Please read [Vitest's comparison page](https://vitest.dev/guide/comparisons.html#cypress) for the latest information comparing Vitest and Cypress.\n\n### Mounting Libraries\n\nComponent testing often involves mounting the component being tested in isolation, triggering simulated user input events, and asserting on the rendered DOM output. There are dedicated utility libraries that make these tasks simpler.\n\n- [`@vue/test-utils`](https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils) is the official low-level component testing library that was written to provide users access to Vue specific APIs. It's also the lower-level library `@testing-library/vue` is built on top of.\n\n- [`@testing-library/vue`](https://github.com/testing-library/vue-testing-library) is a Vue testing library focused on testing components without relying on implementation details. Its guiding principle is that the more tests resemble the way software is used, the more confidence they can provide.\n\nWe recommend using `@vue/test-utils` for testing components in applications. `@testing-library/vue` has issues with testing asynchronous component with Suspense, so it should be used with caution.\n\n### Other Options\n\n- [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/) is an E2E test runner with Vue Component Testing support. ([Example Project](https://github.com/nightwatchjs-community/todo-vue))\n\n- [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/component-testing/vue) for cross-browser component testing that relies on native user interaction based on standardized automation. It can also be used with Testing Library.\n\n## E2E Testing\n\nWhile unit tests provide developers with some degree of confidence, unit and component tests are limited in their abilities to provide holistic coverage of an application when deployed to production. As a result, end-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications.\n\nEnd-to-end tests focus on multi-page application behavior that makes network requests against your production-built Vue application. They often involve standing up a database or other backend and may even be run against a live staging environment.\n\nEnd-to-end tests will often catch issues with your router, state management library, top-level components (e.g. an App or Layout), public assets, or any request handling. As stated above, they catch critical issues that may be impossible to catch with unit tests or component tests.\n\nEnd-to-end tests do not import any of your Vue application's code but instead rely completely on testing your application by navigating through entire pages in a real browser.\n\nEnd-to-end tests validate many of the layers in your application. They can either target your locally built application or even a live Staging environment. Testing against your Staging environment not only includes your frontend code and static server but all associated backend services and infrastructure.\n\n> The more your tests resemble how your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. - [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106) - Author of the Testing Library\n\nBy testing how user actions impact your application, E2E tests are often the key to higher confidence in whether an application is functioning properly or not.\n\n### Choosing an E2E Testing Solution\n\nWhile end-to-end (E2E) testing on the web has gained a negative reputation for unreliable (flaky) tests and slowing down development processes, modern E2E tools have made strides forward to create more reliable, interactive, and useful tests. When choosing an E2E testing framework, the following sections provide some guidance on things to keep in mind when choosing a testing framework for your application.\n\n#### Cross-browser testing\n\nOne of the primary benefits that end-to-end (E2E) testing is known for is its ability to test your application across multiple browsers. While it may seem desirable to have 100% cross-browser coverage, it is important to note that cross browser testing has diminishing returns on a team's resources due to the additional time and machine power required to run them consistently. As a result, it is important to be mindful of this trade-off when choosing the amount of cross-browser testing your application needs.\n\n#### Faster feedback loops\n\nOne of the primary problems with end-to-end (E2E) tests and development is that running the entire suite takes a long time. Typically, this is only done in continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Modern E2E testing frameworks have helped to solve this by adding features like parallelization, which allows for CI/CD pipelines to often run magnitudes faster than before. In addition, when developing locally, the ability to selectively run a single test for the page you are working on while also providing hot reloading of tests can help boost a developer's workflow and productivity.\n\n#### First-class debugging experience\n\nWhile developers have traditionally relied on scanning logs in a terminal window to help determine what went wrong in a test, modern end-to-end (E2E) test frameworks allow developers to leverage tools they are already familiar with, e.g. browser developer tools.\n\n#### Visibility in headless mode\n\nWhen end-to-end (E2E) tests are run in continuous integration/deployment pipelines, they are often run in headless browsers (i.e., no visible browser is opened for the user to watch). A critical feature of modern E2E testing frameworks is the ability to see snapshots and/or videos of the application during testing, providing some insight into why errors are happening. Historically, it was tedious to maintain these integrations.\n\n### Recommendation\n\n- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)\n\n  Overall, we believe Cypress provides the most complete E2E solution with features like an informative graphical interface, excellent debuggability, built-in assertions and stubs, flake-resistance, parallelization, and snapshots. As mentioned above, it also provides support for [Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/introduction). However, it only supports Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.\n\n### Other Options\n\n- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is also a great E2E testing solution with a wider range of browser support (mainly WebKit). See [Why Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/why-playwright) for more details.\n\n- [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/) is an E2E testing solution based on [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver). This gives it the widest browser support range.\n\n- [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) is a test automation framework for web and mobile testing based on the WebDriver protocol.\n\n## Recipes\n\n### Adding Vitest to a Project\n\nIn a Vite-based Vue project, run:\n\n``` sh\n> npm install -D vitest happy-dom @testing-library/vue\n```\n\nNext, update the Vite configuration to add the `test` option block:\n\n``` js\n// vite.config.js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // ...\n  test: {\n    // enable jest-like global test APIs\n    globals: true,\n    // simulate DOM with happy-dom\n    // (requires installing happy-dom as a peer dependency)\n    environment: 'happy-dom'\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nIf you use TypeScript, add `vitest/globals` to the `types` field in your `tsconfig.json`.\n\n``` json\n// tsconfig.json\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"types\": [\"vitest/globals\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, create a file ending in `*.test.js` in your project. You can place all test files in a test directory in the project root or in test directories next to your source files. Vitest will automatically search for them using the naming convention.\n\n``` js\n// MyComponent.test.js\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/vue'\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'\n\ntest('it should work', () => {\n  const { getByText } = render(MyComponent, {\n    props: {\n      /* ... */\n    }\n  })\n\n  // assert output\n  getByText('...')\n})\n```\n\nFinally, update `package.json` to add the test script and run it:\n\n``` json\n{\n  // ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"vitest\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` sh\n> npm test\n```\n\n### Testing Composables\n\n> This section assumes you have read the [Composables](../reusability/composables) section.\n\nWhen it comes to testing composables, we can divide them into two categories: composables that do not rely on a host component instance, and composables that do.\n\nA composable depends on a host component instance when it uses the following APIs:\n\n- Lifecycle hooks\n- Provide / Inject\n\nIf a composable only uses Reactivity APIs, then it can be tested by directly invoking it and asserting its returned state/methods:\n\n``` js\n// counter.js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useCounter() {\n  const count = ref(0)\n  const increment = () => count.value++\n\n  return {\n    count,\n    increment\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// counter.test.js\nimport { useCounter } from './counter.js'\n\ntest('useCounter', () => {\n  const { count, increment } = useCounter()\n  expect(count.value).toBe(0)\n\n  increment()\n  expect(count.value).toBe(1)\n})\n```\n\nA composable that relies on lifecycle hooks or Provide / Inject needs to be wrapped in a host component to be tested. We can create a helper like the following:\n\n``` js\n// test-utils.js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nexport function withSetup(composable) {\n  let result\n  const app = createApp({\n    setup() {\n      result = composable()\n      // suppress missing template warning\n      return () => {}\n    }\n  })\n  app.mount(document.createElement('div'))\n  // return the result and the app instance\n  // for testing provide/unmount\n  return [result, app]\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { withSetup } from './test-utils'\nimport { useFoo } from './foo'\n\ntest('useFoo', () => {\n  const [result, app] = withSetup(() => useFoo(123))\n  // mock provide for testing injections\n  app.provide(...)\n  // run assertions\n  expect(result.foo.value).toBe(1)\n  // trigger onUnmounted hook if needed\n  app.unmount()\n})\n```\n\nFor more complex composables, it could also be easier to test it by writing tests against the wrapper component using [Component Testing](#component-testing) techniques.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/testing](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/testing)"

  summary: Vue.js is a framework for building client-side applications
  description: "# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\n## Overview\n\n### What is SSR?\n\nVue.js is a framework for building client-side applications. By default, Vue components produce and manipulate DOM in the browser as output. However, it is also possible to render the same components into HTML strings on the server, send them directly to the browser, and finally \"hydrate\" the static markup into a fully interactive app on the client.\n\nA server-rendered Vue.js app can also be considered \"isomorphic\" or \"universal\", in the sense that the majority of your app's code runs on both the server **and** the client.\n\n### Why SSR?\n\nCompared to a client-side Single-Page Application (SPA), the advantage of SSR primarily lies in:\n\n- **Faster time-to-content**: this is more prominent on slow internet or slow devices. Server-rendered markup doesn't need to wait until all JavaScript has been downloaded and executed to be displayed, so your user will see a fully-rendered page sooner. In addition, data fetching is done on the server-side for the initial visit, which likely has a faster connection to your database than the client. This generally results in improved [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) metrics, better user experience, and can be critical for applications where time-to-content is directly associated with conversion rate.\n\n- **Unified mental model**: you get to use the same language and the same declarative, component-oriented mental model for developing your entire app, instead of jumping back and forth between a backend templating system and a frontend framework.\n\n- **Better SEO**: the search engine crawlers will directly see the fully rendered page.\n\n  **TIP**\n  As of now, Google and Bing can index synchronous JavaScript applications just fine. Synchronous being the key word there. If your app starts with a loading spinner, then fetches content via Ajax, the crawler will not wait for you to finish. This means if you have content fetched asynchronously on pages where SEO is important, SSR might be necessary.\n\nThere are also some trade-offs to consider when using SSR:\n\n- Development constraints. Browser-specific code can only be used inside certain lifecycle hooks; some external libraries may need special treatment to be able to run in a server-rendered app.\n\n- More involved build setup and deployment requirements. Unlike a fully static SPA that can be deployed on any static file server, a server-rendered app requires an environment where a Node.js server can run.\n\n- More server-side load. Rendering a full app in Node.js is going to be more CPU-intensive than just serving static files, so if you expect high traffic, be prepared for corresponding server load and wisely employ caching strategies.\n\nBefore using SSR for your app, the first question you should ask is whether you actually need it. It mostly depends on how important time-to-content is for your app. For example, if you are building an internal dashboard where an extra few hundred milliseconds on initial load doesn't matter that much, SSR would be an overkill. However, in cases where time-to-content is absolutely critical, SSR can help you achieve the best possible initial load performance.\n\n### SSR vs. SSG\n\n**Static Site Generation (SSG)**, also referred to as pre-rendering, is another popular technique for building fast websites. If the data needed to server-render a page is the same for every user, then instead of rendering the page every time a request comes in, we can render it only once, ahead of time, during the build process. Pre-rendered pages are generated and served as static HTML files.\n\nSSG retains the same performance characteristics of SSR apps: it provides great time-to-content performance. At the same time, it is cheaper and easier to deploy than SSR apps because the output is static HTML and assets. The keyword here is **static**: SSG can only be applied to pages consuming static data, i.e. data that is known at build time and does not change between deploys. Every time the data changes, a new deployment is needed.\n\nIf you're only investigating SSR to improve the SEO of a handful of marketing pages (e.g. `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, etc.), then you probably want SSG instead of SSR. SSG is also great for content-based websites such as documentation sites or blogs. In fact, this website you are reading right now is statically generated using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a Vue-powered static site generator.\n\n## Basic Tutorial\n\n### Rendering an App\n\nLet's take a look at the most bare-bones example of Vue SSR in action.\n\n1.  Create a new directory and `cd` into it\n2.  Run `npm init -y`\n3.  Add `\"type\": \"module\"` in `package.json` so that Node.js runs in [ES modules mode](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules).\n4.  Run `npm install vue`\n5.  Create an `example.js` file:\n\n``` js\n// this runs in Node.js on the server.\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\n// Vue's server-rendering API is exposed under `vue/server-renderer`.\nimport { renderToString } from 'vue/server-renderer'\n\nconst app = createSSRApp({\n  data: () => ({ count: 1 }),\n  template: `<button @click=\"count++\">{{ count }}</button>`\n})\n\nrenderToString(app).then((html) => {\n  console.log(html)\n})\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n``` sh\n> node example.js\n```\n\nIt should print the following to the command line:\n\n``` \n<button>1</button>\n```\n\n[`renderToString()`](../../api/ssr#rendertostring) takes a Vue app instance and returns a Promise that resolves to the rendered HTML of the app. It is also possible to stream rendering using the [Node.js Stream API](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) or [Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API). Check out the [SSR API Reference](../../api/ssr) for full details.\n\nWe can then move the Vue SSR code into a server request handler, which wraps the application markup with the full page HTML. We will be using [`express`](https://expressjs.com/) for the next steps:\n\n- Run `npm install express`\n- Create the following `server.js` file:\n\n``` js\nimport express from 'express'\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\nimport { renderToString } from 'vue/server-renderer'\n\nconst server = express()\n\nserver.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  const app = createSSRApp({\n    data: () => ({ count: 1 }),\n    template: `<button @click=\"count++\">{{ count }}</button>`\n  })\n\n  renderToString(app).then((html) => {\n    res.send(`\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n      <head>\n        <title>Vue SSR Example</title>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"app\">${html}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n    `)\n  })\n})\n\nserver.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('ready')\n})\n```\n\nFinally, run `node server.js` and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the page working with the button.\n\n[Try it on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/vue-ssr-example-basic?file=index.js)\n\n### Client Hydration\n\nIf you click the button, you'll notice the number doesn't change. The HTML is completely static on the client since we are not loading Vue in the browser.\n\nTo make the client-side app interactive, Vue needs to perform the **hydration** step. During hydration, it creates the same Vue application that was run on the server, matches each component to the DOM nodes it should control, and attaches DOM event listeners.\n\nTo mount an app in hydration mode, we need to use [`createSSRApp()`](../../api/application#createssrapp) instead of `createApp()`:\n\n``` js\n// this runs in the browser.\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createSSRApp({\n  // ...same app as on server\n})\n\n// mounting an SSR app on the client assumes\n// the HTML was pre-rendered and will perform\n// hydration instead of mounting new DOM nodes.\napp.mount('#app')\n```\n\n### Code Structure\n\nNotice how we need to reuse the same app implementation as on the server. This is where we need to start thinking about code structure in an SSR app - how do we share the same application code between the server and the client?\n\nHere we will demonstrate the most bare-bones setup. First, let's split the app creation logic into a dedicated file, `app.js`:\n\n``` js\n// app.js (shared between server and client)\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\n\nexport function createApp() {\n  return createSSRApp({\n    data: () => ({ count: 1 }),\n    template: `<button @click=\"count++\">{{ count }}</button>`\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThis file and its dependencies are shared between the server and the client - we call them **universal code**. There are a number of things you need to pay attention to when writing universal code, as we will [discuss below](#writing-ssr-friendly-code).\n\nOur client entry imports the universal code, creates the app, and performs the mount:\n\n``` js\n// client.js\nimport { createApp } from './app.js'\n\ncreateApp().mount('#app')\n```\n\nAnd the server uses the same app creation logic in the request handler:\n\n``` js\n// server.js (irrelevant code omitted)\nimport { createApp } from './app.js'\n\nserver.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  const app = createApp()\n  renderToString(app).then(html => {\n    // ...\n  })\n})\n```\n\nIn addition, in order to load the client files in the browser, we also need to:\n\n1.  Serve client files by adding `server.use(express.static('.'))` in `server.js`.\n2.  Load the client entry by adding `<script type=\"module\" src=\"/client.js\"></script>` to the HTML shell.\n3.  Support usage like `import * from 'vue'` in the browser by adding an [Import Map](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) to the HTML shell.\n\n[Try the completed example on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/vue-ssr-example?file=index.js). The button is now interactive!\n\n## Higher Level Solutions\n\nMoving from the example to a production-ready SSR app involves a lot more. We will need to:\n\n- Support Vue SFCs and other build step requirements. In fact, we will need to coordinate two builds for the same app: one for the client, and one for the server.\n\n  **TIP**\n  Vue components are compiled differently when used for SSR - templates are compiled into string concatenations instead of Virtual DOM render functions for more efficient rendering performance.\n\n- In the server request handler, render the HTML with the correct client-side asset links and optimal resource hints. We may also need to switch between SSR and SSG mode, or even mix both in the same app.\n\n- Manage routing, data fetching, and state management stores in a universal manner.\n\nA complete implementation would be quite complex and depends on the build toolchain you have chosen to work with. Therefore, we highly recommend going with a higher-level, opinionated solution that abstracts away the complexity for you. Below we will introduce a few recommended SSR solutions in the Vue ecosystem.\n\n### Nuxt\n\n[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is a higher-level framework built on top of the Vue ecosystem which provides a streamlined development experience for writing universal Vue applications. Better yet, you can also use it as a static site generator! We highly recommend giving it a try.\n\n### Quasar\n\n[Quasar](https://quasar.dev) is a complete Vue-based solution that allows you to target SPA, SSR, PWA, mobile app, desktop app, and browser extension all using one codebase. It not only handles the build setup, but also provides a full collection of Material Design compliant UI components.\n\n### Vite SSR\n\nVite provides built-in [support for Vue server-side rendering](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html), but it is intentionally low-level. If you wish to go directly with Vite, check out [vite-plugin-ssr](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/), a community plugin that abstracts away many challenging details for you.\n\nYou can also find an example Vue + Vite SSR project using manual setup [here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/playground/ssr-vue), which can serve as a base to build upon. Note this is only recommended if you are experienced with SSR / build tools and really want to have complete control over the higher-level architecture.\n\n## Writing SSR-friendly Code\n\nRegardless of your build setup or higher-level framework choice, there are some principles that apply in all Vue SSR applications.\n\n### Reactivity on the Server\n\nDuring SSR, each request URL maps to a desired state of our application. There is no user interaction and no DOM updates, so reactivity is unnecessary on the server. By default, reactivity is disabled during SSR for better performance.\n\n### Component Lifecycle Hooks\n\nSince there are no dynamic updates, lifecycle hooks such as `mounted``onMounted` or `updated``onUpdated` will **NOT** be called during SSR and will only be executed on the client. The only hooks that are called during SSR are `beforeCreate` and `created`\n\nYou should avoid code that produces side effects that need cleanup in `beforeCreate` and `created``setup()` or the root scope of `<script setup>`. An example of such side effects is setting up timers with `setInterval`. In client-side only code we may setup a timer and then tear it down in `beforeUnmount``onBeforeUnmount` or `unmounted``onUnmounted`. However, because the unmount hooks will never be called during SSR, the timers will stay around forever. To avoid this, move your side-effect code into `mounted``onMounted` instead.\n\n### Access to Platform-Specific APIs\n\nUniversal code cannot assume access to platform-specific APIs, so if your code directly uses browser-only globals like `window` or `document`, they will throw errors when executed in Node.js, and vice-versa.\n\nFor tasks that are shared between server and client but with different platform APIs, it's recommended to wrap the platform-specific implementations inside a universal API, or use libraries that do this for you. For example, you can use [`node-fetch`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) to use the same fetch API on both server and client.\n\nFor browser-only APIs, the common approach is to lazily access them inside client-only lifecycle hooks such as `mounted``onMounted`.\n\nNote that if a third-party library is not written with universal usage in mind, it could be tricky to integrate it into a server-rendered app. You *might* be able to get it working by mocking some of the globals, but it would be hacky and may interfere with the environment detection code of other libraries.\n\n### Cross-Request State Pollution\n\nIn the State Management chapter, we introduced a [simple state management pattern using Reactivity APIs](state-management#simple-state-management-with-reactivity-api). In an SSR context, this pattern requires some additional adjustments.\n\nThe pattern declares shared state in a JavaScript module's root scope. This makes them **singletons** - i.e. there is only one instance of the reactive object throughout the entire lifecycle of our application. This works as expected in a pure client-side Vue application, since the modules in our application are initialized fresh for each browser page visit.\n\nHowever, in an SSR context, the application modules are typically initialized only once on the server, when the server boots up. The same module instances will be reused across multiple server requests, and so will our singleton state objects. If we mutate the shared singleton state with data specific to one user, it can be accidentally leaked to a request from another user. We call this **cross-request state pollution.**\n\nWe can technically re-initialize all the JavaScript modules on each request, just like we do in browsers. However, initializing JavaScript modules can be costly, so this would significantly affect server performance.\n\nThe recommended solution is to create a new instance of the entire application - including the router and global stores - on each request. Then, instead of directly importing it in our components, we provide the shared state using [app-level provide](../components/provide-inject#app-level-provide) and inject it in components that need it:\n\n``` js\n// app.js (shared between server and client)\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\nimport { createStore } from './store.js'\n\n// called on each request\nexport function createApp() {\n  const app = createSSRApp(/* ... */)\n  // create new instance of store per request\n  const store = createStore(/* ... */)\n  // provide store at the app level\n  app.provide('store', store)\n  // also expose store for hydration purposes\n  return { app, store }\n}\n```\n\nState Management libraries like Pinia are designed with this in mind. Consult [Pinia's SSR guide](https://pinia.vuejs.org/ssr/) for more details.\n\n### Hydration Mismatch\n\nIf the DOM structure of the pre-rendered HTML does not match the expected output of the client-side app, there will be a hydration mismatch error. Hydration mismatch is most commonly introduced by the following causes:\n\n1.  The template contains invalid HTML nesting structure, and the rendered HTML got \"corrected\" by the browser's native HTML parsing behavior. For example, a common gotcha is that [`<div>` cannot be placed inside `<p>`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8397852/why-cant-the-p-tag-contain-a-div-tag-inside-it):\n\n    ``` html\n    <p><div>hi</div></p>\n    ```\n\n    If we produce this in our server-rendered HTML, the browser will terminate the first `<p>` when `<div>` is encountered and parse it into the following DOM structure:\n\n    ``` html\n    <p></p>\n    <div>hi</div>\n    <p></p>\n    ```\n\n2.  The data used during render contains randomly generated values. Since the same application will run twice - once on the server, and once on the client - the random values are not guaranteed to be the same between the two runs. There are two ways to avoid random-value-induced mismatches:\n\n    1.  Use `v-if` + `onMounted` to render the part that depends on random values only on the client. Your framework may also have built-in features to make this easier, for example the `<ClientOnly>` component in VitePress.\n\n    2.  Use a random number generator library that supports generating with seeds, and guarantee the server run and the client run are using the same seed (e.g. by including the seed in serialized state and retrieving it on the client).\n\n3.  The server and the client are in different time zones. Sometimes, we may want to convert a timestamp into the user's local time. However, the timezone during the server run and the timezone during the client run are not always the same, and we may not reliably know the user's timezone during the server run. In such cases, the local time conversion should also be performed as a client-only operation.\n\nWhen Vue encounters a hydration mismatch, it will attempt to automatically recover and adjust the pre-rendered DOM to match the client-side state. This will lead to some rendering performance loss due to incorrect nodes being discarded and new nodes being mounted, but in most cases, the app should continue to work as expected. That said, it is still best to eliminate hydration mismatches during development.\n\n### Custom Directives\n\nSince most custom directives involve direct DOM manipulation, they are ignored during SSR. However, if you want to specify how a custom directive should be rendered (i.e. what attributes it should add to the rendered element), you can use the `getSSRProps` directive hook:\n\n``` js\nconst myDirective = {\n  mounted(el, binding) {\n    // client-side implementation:\n    // directly update the DOM\n    el.id = binding.value\n  },\n  getSSRProps(binding) {\n    // server-side implementation:\n    // return the props to be rendered.\n    // getSSRProps only receives the directive binding.\n    return {\n      id: binding.value\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Teleports\n\nTeleports require special handling during SSR. If the rendered app contains Teleports, the teleported content will not be part of the rendered string. An easier solution is to conditionally render the Teleport on mount.\n\nIf you do need to hydrate teleported content, they are exposed under the `teleports` property of the ssr context object:\n\n``` js\nconst ctx = {}\nconst html = await renderToString(app, ctx)\n\nconsole.log(ctx.teleports) // { '#teleported': 'teleported content' }\n```\n\nYou need to inject the teleport markup into the correct location in your final page HTML similar to how you need to inject the main app markup.\n\n**TIP**\n\nAvoid targeting `body` when using Teleports and SSR together - usually, `<body>` will contain other server-rendered content which makes it impossible for Teleports to determine the correct starting location for hydration.\n\nInstead, prefer a dedicated container, e.g. `<div id=\"teleported\"></div>` which contains only teleported content.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr)"

  summary: However, these features become useless in production
  description: "# Production Deployment\n\n## Development vs. Production\n\nDuring development, Vue provides a number of features to improve the development experience:\n\n- Warning for common errors and pitfalls\n- Props / events validation\n- [Reactivity debugging hooks](../extras/reactivity-in-depth#reactivity-debugging)\n- Devtools integration\n\nHowever, these features become useless in production. Some of the warning checks can also incur a small amount of performance overhead. When deploying to production, we should drop all the unused, development-only code branches for smaller payload size and better performance.\n\n## Without Build Tools\n\nIf you are using Vue without a build tool by loading it from a CDN or self-hosted script, make sure to use the production build (dist files that end in `.prod.js`) when deploying to production. Production builds are pre-minified with all development-only code branches removed.\n\n- If using global build (accessing via the `Vue` global): use `vue.global.prod.js`.\n- If using ESM build (accessing via native ESM imports): use `vue.esm-browser.prod.js`.\n\nConsult the [dist file guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#which-dist-file-to-use) for more details.\n\n## With Build Tools\n\nProjects scaffolded via `create-vue` (based on Vite) or Vue CLI (based on webpack) are pre-configured for production builds.\n\nIf using a custom setup, make sure that:\n\n1.  `vue` resolves to `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`.\n2.  The [compile time feature flags](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#bundler-build-feature-flags) are properly configured.\n3.  `process.env.NODE_ENV` is replaced with `\"production\"` during build.\n\nAdditional references:\n\n- [Vite production build guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)\n- [Vite deployment guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)\n- [Vue CLI deployment guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html)\n\n## Tracking Runtime Errors\n\nThe [app-level error handler](../../api/application#app-config-errorhandler) can be used to report errors to tracking services:\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp(...)\n\napp.config.errorHandler = (err, instance, info) => {\n  // report error to tracking services\n}\n```\n\nServices such as [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/) and [Bugsnag](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript/vue/) also provide official integrations for Vue.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/production-deployment](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/production-deployment)"

  summary: Vue is designed to be performant for most common use cases without much need for manual optimizations
  description: "# Performance\n\n## Overview\n\nVue is designed to be performant for most common use cases without much need for manual optimizations. However, there are always challenging scenarios where extra fine-tuning is needed. In this section, we will discuss what you should pay attention to when it comes to performance in a Vue application.\n\nFirst, let's discuss the two major aspects of web performance:\n\n- **Page Load Performance**: how fast the application shows content and becomes interactive on the initial visit. This is usually measured using web vital metrics like [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/) and [First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/fid/).\n\n- **Update Performance**: how fast the application updates in response to user input. For example, how fast a list updates when the user types in a search box, or how fast the page switches when the user clicks a navigation link in a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n\nWhile it would be ideal to maximize both, different frontend architectures tend to affect how easy it is to attain desired performance in these aspects. In addition, the type of application you are building greatly influences what you should prioritize in terms of performance. Therefore, the first step of ensuring optimal performance is picking the right architecture for the type of application you are building:\n\n- Consult [Ways of Using Vue](../extras/ways-of-using-vue) to see how you can leverage Vue in different ways.\n\n- Jason Miller discusses the types of web applications and their respective ideal implementation / delivery in [Application Holotypes](https://jasonformat.com/application-holotypes/).\n\n## Profiling Options\n\nTo improve performance, we need to first know how to measure it. There are a number of great tools that can help in this regard:\n\nFor profiling load performance of production deployments:\n\n- [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)\n- [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)\n\nFor profiling performance during local development:\n\n- [Chrome DevTools Performance Panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/)\n  - [`app.config.performance`](../../api/application#app-config-performance) enables Vue-specific performance markers in Chrome DevTools' performance timeline.\n- [Vue DevTools Extension](../scaling-up/tooling#browser-devtools) also provides a performance profiling feature.\n\n## Page Load Optimizations\n\nThere are many framework-agnostic aspects for optimizing page load performance - check out [this web.dev guide](https://web.dev/fast/) for a comprehensive round up. Here, we will primarily focus on techniques that are specific to Vue.\n\n### Choosing the Right Architecture\n\nIf your use case is sensitive to page load performance, avoid shipping it as a pure client-side SPA. You want your server to be directly sending HTML containing the content the users want to see. Pure client-side rendering suffers from slow time-to-content. This can be mitigated with [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](../extras/ways-of-using-vue#fullstack-ssr) or [Static Site Generation (SSG)](../extras/ways-of-using-vue#jamstack-ssg). Check out the [SSR Guide](../scaling-up/ssr) to learn about performing SSR with Vue. If your app doesn't have rich interactivity requirements, you can also use a traditional backend server to render the HTML and enhance it with Vue on the client.\n\nIf your main application has to be an SPA, but has marketing pages (landing, about, blog), ship them separately! Your marketing pages should ideally be deployed as static HTML with minimal JS, by using SSG.\n\n### Bundle Size and Tree-shaking\n\nOne of the most effective ways to improve page load performance is shipping smaller JavaScript bundles. Here are a few ways to reduce bundle size when using Vue:\n\n- Use a build step if possible.\n\n  - Many of Vue's APIs are [\"tree-shakable\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) if bundled via a modern build tool. For example, if you don't use the built-in `<Transition>` component, it won't be included in the final production bundle. Tree-shaking can also remove other unused modules in your source code.\n\n  - When using a build step, templates are pre-compiled so we don't need to ship the Vue compiler to the browser. This saves **14kb** min+gzipped JavaScript and avoids the runtime compilation cost.\n\n- Be cautious of size when introducing new dependencies! In real-world applications, bloated bundles are most often a result of introducing heavy dependencies without realizing it.\n\n  - If using a build step, prefer dependencies that offer ES module formats and are tree-shaking friendly. For example, prefer `lodash-es` over `lodash`.\n\n  - Check a dependency's size and evaluate whether it is worth the functionality it provides. Note if the dependency is tree-shaking friendly, the actual size increase will depend on the APIs you actually import from it. Tools like [bundlejs.com](https://bundlejs.com/) can be used for quick checks, but measuring with your actual build setup will always be the most accurate.\n\n- If you are using Vue primarily for progressive enhancement and prefer to avoid a build step, consider using [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) (only **6kb**) instead.\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nCode splitting is where a build tool splits the application bundle into multiple smaller chunks, which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. With proper code splitting, features required at page load can be downloaded immediately, with additional chunks being lazy loaded only when needed, thus improving performance.\n\nBundlers like Rollup (which Vite is based upon) or webpack can automatically create split chunks by detecting the ESM dynamic import syntax:\n\n``` js\n// lazy.js and its dependencies will be split into a separate chunk\n// and only loaded when `loadLazy()` is called.\nfunction loadLazy() {\n  return import('./lazy.js')\n}\n```\n\nLazy loading is best used on features that are not immediately needed after initial page load. In Vue applications, this can be used in combination with Vue's [Async Component](../components/async) feature to create split chunks for component trees:\n\n``` js\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\n// a separate chunk is created for Foo.vue and its dependencies.\n// it is only fetched on demand when the async component is\n// rendered on the page.\nconst Foo = defineAsyncComponent(() => import('./Foo.vue'))\n```\n\nFor applications using Vue Router, it is strongly recommended to use lazy loading for route components. Vue Router has explicit support for lazy loading, separate from `defineAsyncComponent`. See [Lazy Loading Routes](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html) for more details.\n\n## Update Optimizations\n\n### Props Stability\n\nIn Vue, a child component only updates when at least one of its received props has changed. Consider the following example:\n\n``` template\n<ListItem\n  v-for=\"item in list\"\n  :id=\"item.id\"\n  :active-id=\"activeId\" />\n```\n\nInside the `<ListItem>` component, it uses its `id` and `activeId` props to determine whether it is the currently active item. While this works, the problem is that whenever `activeId` changes, **every** `<ListItem>` in the list has to update!\n\nIdeally, only the items whose active status changed should update. We can achieve that by moving the active status computation into the parent, and make `<ListItem>` directly accept an `active` prop instead:\n\n``` template\n<ListItem\n  v-for=\"item in list\"\n  :id=\"item.id\"\n  :active=\"item.id === activeId\" />\n```\n\nNow, for most components the `active` prop will remain the same when `activeId` changes, so they no longer need to update. In general, the idea is keeping the props passed to child components as stable as possible.\n\n### `v-once`\n\n`v-once` is a built-in directive that can be used to render content that relies on runtime data but never needs to update. The entire sub-tree it is used on will be skipped for all future updates. Consult its [API reference](../../api/built-in-directives#v-once) for more details.\n\n### `v-memo`\n\n`v-memo` is a built-in directive that can be used to conditionally skip the update of large sub-trees or `v-for` lists. Consult its [API reference](../../api/built-in-directives#v-memo) for more details.\n\n### Computed Stability\n\nStarting in 3.4, a computed property will only trigger effects when its computed value has changed from the previous one. For example, the following `isEven` computed only triggers effects if the returned value has changed from `true` to `false`, or vice-versa:\n\n``` js\nconst count = ref(0)\nconst isEven = computed(() => count.value % 2 === 0)\n\nwatchEffect(() => console.log(isEven.value)) // true\n\n// will not trigger new logs because the computed value stays `true`\ncount.value = 2\ncount.value = 4\n```\n\nThis reduces unnecessary effect triggers, but unfortunately doesn't work if the computed creates a new object on each compute:\n\n``` js\nconst computedObj = computed(() => {\n  return {\n    isEven: count.value % 2 === 0\n  }\n})\n```\n\nBecause a new object is created each time, the new value is technically always different from the old value. Even if the `isEven` property remains the same, Vue won't be able to know unless it performs a deep comparison of the old value and the new value. Such comparison could be expensive and likely not worth it.\n\nInstead, we can optimize this by manually comparing the new value with the old value, and conditionally returning the old value if we know nothing has changed:\n\n``` js\nconst computedObj = computed((oldValue) => {\n  const newValue = {\n    isEven: count.value % 2 === 0\n  }\n  if (oldValue && oldValue.isEven === newValue.isEven) {\n    return oldValue\n  }\n  return newValue\n})\n```\n\n[Playground Example](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\nNote that you should always perform the full computation before comparing and returning the old value, so that the same dependencies can be collected on every run.\n\n## General Optimizations\n\n> The following tips affect both page load and update performance.\n\n### Virtualize Large Lists\n\nOne of the most common performance issues in all frontend applications is rendering large lists. No matter how performant a framework is, rendering a list with thousands of items **will** be slow due to the sheer number of DOM nodes that the browser needs to handle.\n\nHowever, we don't necessarily have to render all these nodes upfront. In most cases, the user's screen size can display only a small subset of our large list. We can greatly improve the performance with **list virtualization**, the technique of only rendering the items that are currently in or close to the viewport in a large list.\n\nImplementing list virtualization isn't easy, luckily there are existing community libraries that you can directly use:\n\n- [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller)\n- [vue-virtual-scroll-grid](https://github.com/rocwang/vue-virtual-scroll-grid)\n- [vueuc/VVirtualList](https://github.com/07akioni/vueuc)\n\n### Reduce Reactivity Overhead for Large Immutable Structures\n\nVue's reactivity system is deep by default. While this makes state management intuitive, it does create a certain level of overhead when the data size is large, because every property access triggers proxy traps that perform dependency tracking. This typically becomes noticeable when dealing with large arrays of deeply nested objects, where a single render needs to access 100,000+ properties, so it should only affect very specific use cases.\n\nVue does provide an escape hatch to opt-out of deep reactivity by using [`shallowRef()`](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref) and [`shallowReactive()`](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive). Shallow APIs create state that is reactive only at the root level, and exposes all nested objects untouched. This keeps nested property access fast, with the trade-off being that we must now treat all nested objects as immutable, and updates can only be triggered by replacing the root state:\n\n``` js\nconst shallowArray = shallowRef([\n  /* big list of deep objects */\n])\n\n// this won't trigger updates...\nshallowArray.value.push(newObject)\n// this does:\nshallowArray.value = [...shallowArray.value, newObject]\n\n// this won't trigger updates...\nshallowArray.value[0].foo = 1\n// this does:\nshallowArray.value = [\n  {\n    ...shallowArray.value[0],\n    foo: 1\n  },\n  ...shallowArray.value.slice(1)\n]\n```\n\n### Avoid Unnecessary Component Abstractions\n\nSometimes we may create [renderless components](../components/slots#renderless-components) or higher-order components (i.e. components that render other components with extra props) for better abstraction or code organization. While there is nothing wrong with this, do keep in mind that component instances are much more expensive than plain DOM nodes, and creating too many of them due to abstraction patterns will incur performance costs.\n\nNote that reducing only a few instances won't have noticeable effect, so don't sweat it if the component is rendered only a few times in the app. The best scenario to consider this optimization is again in large lists. Imagine a list of 100 items where each item component contains many child components. Removing one unnecessary component abstraction here could result in a reduction of hundreds of component instances.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/performance](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/performance)"

  summary: Web accessibility (also known as a11y) refers to the practice of creating websites that can be used by anyone — be that a person with a disability, a slow connection, outdated or broken hardware or simply someone in an unfavorable environment
  description: "# Accessibility\n\nWeb accessibility (also known as a11y) refers to the practice of creating websites that can be used by anyone — be that a person with a disability, a slow connection, outdated or broken hardware or simply someone in an unfavorable environment. For example, adding subtitles to a video would help both your deaf and hard-of-hearing users and your users who are in a loud environment and can't hear their phone. Similarly, making sure your text isn't too low contrast will help both your low-vision users and your users who are trying to use their phone in bright sunlight.\n\nReady to start but aren’t sure where?\n\nCheckout the [Planning and managing web accessibility guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/) provided by [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/)\n\n## Skip link\n\nYou should add a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area so users can skip content that is repeated on multiple Web pages.\n\nTypically this is done on the top of `App.vue` as it will be the first focusable element on all your pages:\n\n``` template\n<ul class=\"skip-links\">\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#main\" ref=\"skipLink\" class=\"skip-link\">Skip to main content</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nTo hide the link unless it is focused, you can add the following style:\n\n``` css\n.skip-link {\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  margin: 1em auto;\n  top: 0;\n  position: fixed;\n  left: 50%;\n  margin-left: -72px;\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.skip-link:focus {\n  opacity: 1;\n  background-color: white;\n  padding: 0.5em;\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n```\n\nOnce a user changes route, bring focus back to the skip link. This can be achieved by calling focus on the skip link's template ref (assuming usage of `vue-router`):\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  watch: {\n    $route() {\n      this.$refs.skipLink.focus()\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, watch } from 'vue'\nimport { useRoute } from 'vue-router'\n\nconst route = useRoute()\nconst skipLink = ref()\n\nwatch(\n  () => route.path,\n  () => {\n    skipLink.value.focus()\n  }\n)\n</script>\n```\n\n[Read documentation on skip link to main content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1.html)\n\n## Content Structure\n\nOne of the most important pieces of accessibility is making sure that design can support accessible implementation. Design should consider not only color contrast, font selection, text sizing, and language, but also how the content is structured in the application.\n\n### Headings\n\nUsers can navigate an application through headings. Having descriptive headings for every section of your application makes it easier for users to predict the content of each section. When it comes to headings, there are a couple of recommended accessibility practices:\n\n- Nest headings in their ranking order: `<h1>` - `<h6>`\n- Don’t skip headings within a section\n- Use actual heading tags instead of styling text to give the visual appearance of headings\n\n[Read more about headings](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html)\n\n``` template\n<main role=\"main\" aria-labelledby=\"main-title\">\n  <h1 id=\"main-title\">Main title</h1>\n  <section aria-labelledby=\"section-title-1\">\n    <h2 id=\"section-title-1\"> Section Title </h2>\n    <h3>Section Subtitle</h3>\n    <!-- Content -->\n  </section>\n  <section aria-labelledby=\"section-title-2\">\n    <h2 id=\"section-title-2\"> Section Title </h2>\n    <h3>Section Subtitle</h3>\n    <!-- Content -->\n    <h3>Section Subtitle</h3>\n    <!-- Content -->\n  </section>\n</main>\n```\n\n### Landmarks\n\n[Landmarks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/landmark_role) provide programmatic access to sections within an application. Users who rely on assistive technology can navigate to each section of the application and skip over content. You can use [ARIA roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) to help you achieve this.\n\n| HTML    | ARIA Role            | Landmark Purpose                                                                                                 |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| header  | role=\"banner\"        | Prime heading: title of the page                                                                                 |\n| nav     | role=\"navigation\"    | Collection of links suitable for use when navigating the document or related documents                           |\n| main    | role=\"main\"          | The main or central content of the document.                                                                     |\n| footer  | role=\"contentinfo\"   | Information about the parent document: footnotes/copyrights/links to privacy statement                           |\n| aside   | role=\"complementary\" | Supports the main content, yet is separated and meaningful on its own content                                    |\n| search  | role=\"search\"        | This section contains the search functionality for the application                                               |\n| form    | role=\"form\"          | Collection of form-associated elements                                                                           |\n| section | role=\"region\"        | Content that is relevant and that users will likely want to navigate to. Label must be provided for this element |\n\n**Tip:**\n\nIt is recommended to use landmark HTML elements with redundant landmark role attributes in order to maximize compatibility with legacy [browsers that don’t support HTML5 semantic elements](https://caniuse.com/#feat=html5semantic).\n\n[Read more about landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#landmark_roles)\n\n## Semantic Forms\n\nWhen creating a form, you can use the following elements: `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`\n\nLabels are typically placed on top or to the left of the form fields:\n\n``` template\n<form action=\"/dataCollectionLocation\" method=\"post\" autocomplete=\"on\">\n  <div v-for=\"item in formItems\" :key=\"item.id\" class=\"form-item\">\n    <label :for=\"item.id\">{{ item.label }}: </label>\n    <input\n      :type=\"item.type\"\n      :id=\"item.id\"\n      :name=\"item.id\"\n      v-model=\"item.value\"\n    />\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nNotice how you can include `autocomplete='on'` on the form element and it will apply to all inputs in your form. You can also set different [values for autocomplete attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) for each input.\n\n### Labels\n\nProvide labels to describe the purpose of all form control; linking `for` and `id`:\n\n``` template\n<label for=\"name\">Name: </label>\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" v-model=\"name\" />\n```\n\nIf you inspect this element in your chrome developer tools and open the Accessibility tab inside the Elements tab, you will see how the input gets its name from the label:\n\n**Warning:**\n\nThough you might have seen labels wrapping the input fields like this:\n\n``` template\n<label>\n  Name:\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" v-model=\"name\" />\n</label>\n```\n\nExplicitly setting the labels with a matching id is better supported by assistive technology.\n\n#### `aria-label`\n\nYou can also give the input an accessible name with [`aria-label`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label).\n\n``` template\n<label for=\"name\">Name: </label>\n<input\n  type=\"text\"\n  name=\"name\"\n  id=\"name\"\n  v-model=\"name\"\n  :aria-label=\"nameLabel\"\n/>\n```\n\nFeel free to inspect this element in Chrome DevTools to see how the accessible name has changed:\n\n#### `aria-labelledby`\n\nUsing [`aria-labelledby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) is similar to `aria-label` except it is used if the label text is visible on screen. It is paired to other elements by their `id` and you can link multiple `id`s:\n\n``` template\n<form\n  class=\"demo\"\n  action=\"/dataCollectionLocation\"\n  method=\"post\"\n  autocomplete=\"on\"\n>\n  <h1 id=\"billing\">Billing</h1>\n  <div class=\"form-item\">\n    <label for=\"name\">Name: </label>\n    <input\n      type=\"text\"\n      name=\"name\"\n      id=\"name\"\n      v-model=\"name\"\n      aria-labelledby=\"billing name\"\n    />\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n#### `aria-describedby`\n\n[aria-describedby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) is used the same way as `aria-labelledby` except provides a description with additional information that the user might need. This can be used to describe the criteria for any input:\n\n``` template\n<form\n  class=\"demo\"\n  action=\"/dataCollectionLocation\"\n  method=\"post\"\n  autocomplete=\"on\"\n>\n  <h1 id=\"billing\">Billing</h1>\n  <div class=\"form-item\">\n    <label for=\"name\">Full Name: </label>\n    <input\n      type=\"text\"\n      name=\"name\"\n      id=\"name\"\n      v-model=\"name\"\n      aria-labelledby=\"billing name\"\n      aria-describedby=\"nameDescription\"\n    />\n    <p id=\"nameDescription\">Please provide first and last name.</p>\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nYou can see the description by inspecting Chrome DevTools:\n\n### Placeholder\n\nAvoid using placeholders as they can confuse many users.\n\nOne of the issues with placeholders is that they don't meet the [color contrast criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) by default; fixing the color contrast makes the placeholder look like pre-populated data in the input fields. Looking at the following example, you can see that the Last Name placeholder which meets the color contrast criteria looks like pre-populated data:\n\n``` template\n<form\n  class=\"demo\"\n  action=\"/dataCollectionLocation\"\n  method=\"post\"\n  autocomplete=\"on\"\n>\n  <div v-for=\"item in formItems\" :key=\"item.id\" class=\"form-item\">\n    <label :for=\"item.id\">{{ item.label }}: </label>\n    <input\n      type=\"text\"\n      :id=\"item.id\"\n      :name=\"item.id\"\n      v-model=\"item.value\"\n      :placeholder=\"item.placeholder\"\n    />\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n``` css\n/* https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_placeholder.asp */\n\n#lastName::placeholder {\n  /* Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari 10.1+ */\n  color: black;\n  opacity: 1; /* Firefox */\n}\n\n#lastName:-ms-input-placeholder {\n  /* Internet Explorer 10-11 */\n  color: black;\n}\n\n#lastName::-ms-input-placeholder {\n  /* Microsoft Edge */\n  color: black;\n}\n```\n\nIt is best to provide all the information the user needs to fill out forms outside any inputs.\n\n### Instructions\n\nWhen adding instructions for your input fields, make sure to link it correctly to the input. You can provide additional instructions and bind multiple ids inside an [`aria-labelledby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby). This allows for more flexible design.\n\n``` template\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Using aria-labelledby</legend>\n  <label id=\"date-label\" for=\"date\">Current Date: </label>\n  <input\n    type=\"date\"\n    name=\"date\"\n    id=\"date\"\n    aria-labelledby=\"date-label date-instructions\"\n  />\n  <p id=\"date-instructions\">MM/DD/YYYY</p>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can attach the instructions to the input with [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby):\n\n``` template\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Using aria-describedby</legend>\n  <label id=\"dob\" for=\"dob\">Date of Birth: </label>\n  <input type=\"date\" name=\"dob\" id=\"dob\" aria-describedby=\"dob-instructions\" />\n  <p id=\"dob-instructions\">MM/DD/YYYY</p>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n### Hiding Content\n\nUsually it is not recommended to visually hide labels, even if the input has an accessible name. However, if the functionality of the input can be understood with surrounding content, then we can hide the visual label.\n\nLet's look at this search field:\n\n``` template\n<form role=\"search\">\n  <label for=\"search\" class=\"hidden-visually\">Search: </label>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"search\" id=\"search\" v-model=\"search\" />\n  <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nWe can do this because the search button will help visual users identify the purpose of the input field.\n\nWe can use CSS to visually hide elements but keep them available for assistive technology:\n\n``` css\n.hidden-visually {\n  position: absolute;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  height: 1px;\n  width: 1px;\n  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);\n  clip-path: inset(100%);\n}\n```\n\n#### `aria-hidden=\"true\"`\n\nAdding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` will hide the element from assistive technology but leave it visually available for other users. Do not use it on focusable elements, purely on decorative, duplicated or offscreen content.\n\n``` template\n<p>This is not hidden from screen readers.</p>\n<p aria-hidden=\"true\">This is hidden from screen readers.</p>\n```\n\n### Buttons\n\nWhen using buttons inside a form, you must set the type to prevent submitting the form. You can also use an input to create buttons:\n\n``` template\n<form action=\"/dataCollectionLocation\" method=\"post\" autocomplete=\"on\">\n  <!-- Buttons -->\n  <button type=\"button\">Cancel</button>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n\n  <!-- Input buttons -->\n  <input type=\"button\" value=\"Cancel\" />\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n</form>\n```\n\n### Functional Images\n\nYou can use this technique to create functional images.\n\n- Input fields\n\n  - These images will act as a submit type button on forms\n\n  ``` template\n  <form role=\"search\">\n    <label for=\"search\" class=\"hidden-visually\">Search: </label>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"search\" id=\"search\" v-model=\"search\" />\n    <input\n      type=\"image\"\n      class=\"btnImg\"\n      src=\"https://img.icons8.com/search\"\n      alt=\"Search\"\n    />\n  </form>\n  ```\n\n- Icons\n\n``` template\n<form role=\"search\">\n  <label for=\"searchIcon\" class=\"hidden-visually\">Search: </label>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"searchIcon\" id=\"searchIcon\" v-model=\"searchIcon\" />\n  <button type=\"submit\">\n    <i class=\"fas fa-search\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n    <span class=\"hidden-visually\">Search</span>\n  </button>\n</form>\n```\n\n## Standards\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops web accessibility standards for the different components:\n\n- [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)\n  - web browsers and media players, including some aspects of assistive technologies\n- [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)\n  - authoring tools\n- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)\n  - web content - used by developers, authoring tools, and accessibility evaluation tools\n\n### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\n\n[WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) extends on [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and allows implementation of new technologies by addressing changes to the web.

  summary: When a vulnerability is reported, it immediately becomes our top concern, with a full-time contributor dropping everything to work on it
  description: "# Security\n\n## Reporting Vulnerabilities\n\nWhen a vulnerability is reported, it immediately becomes our top concern, with a full-time contributor dropping everything to work on it. To report a vulnerability, please email [security@vuejs.org](mailto:security@vuejs.org).\n\nWhile the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of Vue and its official companion libraries to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.\n\n## Rule No.1: Never Use Non-trusted Templates\n\nThe most fundamental security rule when using Vue is **never use non-trusted content as your component template**. Doing so is equivalent to allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in your application - and worse, could lead to server breaches if the code is executed during server-side rendering. An example of such usage:\n\n``` js\nVue.createApp({\n  template: `<div>` + userProvidedString + `</div>` // NEVER DO THIS\n}).mount('#app')\n```\n\nVue templates are compiled into JavaScript, and expressions inside templates will be executed as part of the rendering process. Although the expressions are evaluated against a specific rendering context, due to the complexity of potential global execution environments, it is impractical for a framework like Vue to completely shield you from potential malicious code execution without incurring unrealistic performance overhead. The most straightforward way to avoid this category of problems altogether is to make sure the contents of your Vue templates are always trusted and entirely controlled by you.\n\n## What Vue Does to Protect You\n\n### HTML content\n\nWhether using templates or render functions, content is automatically escaped. That means in this template:\n\n``` template\n<h1>{{ userProvidedString }}</h1>\n```\n\nif `userProvidedString` contained:\n\n``` js\n'<script>alert(\"hi\")</script>'\n```\n\nthen it would be escaped to the following HTML:\n\n``` template\n&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;hi&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;\n```\n\nthus preventing the script injection. This escaping is done using native browser APIs, like `textContent`, so a vulnerability can only exist if the browser itself is vulnerable.\n\n### Attribute bindings\n\nSimilarly, dynamic attribute bindings are also automatically escaped. That means in this template:\n\n``` template\n<h1 :title=\"userProvidedString\">\n  hello\n</h1>\n```\n\nif `userProvidedString` contained:\n\n``` js\n'\" onclick=\"alert(\\'hi\\')'\n```\n\nthen it would be escaped to the following HTML:\n\n``` template\n&quot; onclick=&quot;alert('hi')\n```\n\nthus preventing the close of the `title` attribute to inject new, arbitrary HTML. This escaping is done using native browser APIs, like `setAttribute`, so a vulnerability can only exist if the browser itself is vulnerable.\n\n## Potential Dangers\n\nIn any web application, allowing unsanitized, user-provided content to be executed as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is potentially dangerous, so it should be avoided wherever possible. There are times when some risk may be acceptable, though.\n\nFor example, services like CodePen and JSFiddle allow user-provided content to be executed, but it's in a context where this is expected and sandboxed to some extent inside iframes. In the cases when an important feature inherently requires some level of vulnerability, it's up to your team to weigh the importance of the feature against the worst-case scenarios the vulnerability enables.\n\n### HTML Injection\n\nAs you learned earlier, Vue automatically escapes HTML content, preventing you from accidentally injecting executable HTML into your application. However, **in cases where you know the HTML is safe**, you can explicitly render HTML content:\n\n- Using a template:\n\n  ``` template\n  <div v-html=\"userProvidedHtml\"></div>\n  ```\n\n- Using a render function:\n\n  ``` js\n  h('div', {\n    innerHTML: this.userProvidedHtml\n  })\n  ```\n\n- Using a render function with JSX:\n\n  ``` jsx\n  <div innerHTML={this.userProvidedHtml}></div>\n  ```\n\n**WARNING**\n\nUser-provided HTML can never be considered 100% safe unless it's in a sandboxed iframe or in a part of the app where only the user who wrote that HTML can ever be exposed to it. Additionally, allowing users to write their own Vue templates brings similar dangers.\n\n### URL Injection\n\nIn a URL like this:\n\n``` template\n<a :href=\"userProvidedUrl\">\n  click me\n</a>\n```\n\nThere's a potential security issue if the URL has not been \"sanitized\" to prevent JavaScript execution using `javascript:`. There are libraries such as [sanitize-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@braintree/sanitize-url) to help with this, but note: if you're ever doing URL sanitization on the frontend, you already have a security issue. **User-provided URLs should always be sanitized by your backend before even being saved to a database.** Then the problem is avoided for *every* client connecting to your API, including native mobile apps. Also note that even with sanitized URLs, Vue cannot help you guarantee that they lead to safe destinations.\n\n### Style Injection\n\nLooking at this example:\n\n``` template\n<a\n  :href=\"sanitizedUrl\"\n  :style=\"userProvidedStyles\"\n>\n  click me\n</a>\n```\n\nLet's assume that `sanitizedUrl` has been sanitized, so that it's definitely a real URL and not JavaScript. With the `userProvidedStyles`, malicious users could still provide CSS to \"click jack\", e.g. styling the link into a transparent box over the \"Log in\" button. Then if `https://user-controlled-website.com/` is built to resemble the login page of your application, they might have just captured a user's real login information.\n\nYou may be able to imagine how allowing user-provided content for a `<style>` element would create an even greater vulnerability, giving that user full control over how to style the entire page. That's why Vue prevents rendering of style tags inside templates, such as:\n\n``` template\n<style>{{ userProvidedStyles }}</style>\n```\n\nTo keep your users fully safe from clickjacking, we recommend only allowing full control over CSS inside a sandboxed iframe. Alternatively, when providing user control through a style binding, we recommend using its [object syntax](../essentials/class-and-style#binding-to-objects-1) and only allowing users to provide values for specific properties it's safe for them to control, like this:\n\n``` template\n<a\n  :href=\"sanitizedUrl\"\n  :style=\"{\n    color: userProvidedColor,\n    background: userProvidedBackground\n  }\"\n>\n  click me\n</a>\n```\n\n### JavaScript Injection\n\nWe strongly discourage ever rendering a `<script>` element with Vue, since templates and render functions should never have side effects. However, this isn't the only way to include strings that would be evaluated as JavaScript at runtime.\n\nEvery HTML element has attributes with values accepting strings of JavaScript, such as `onclick`, `onfocus`, and `onmouseenter`. Binding user-provided JavaScript to any of these event attributes is a potential security risk, so it should be avoided.\n\n**WARNING**\n\nUser-provided JavaScript can never be considered 100% safe unless it's in a sandboxed iframe or in a part of the app where only the user who wrote that JavaScript can ever be exposed to it.\n\nSometimes we receive vulnerability reports on how it's possible to do cross-site scripting (XSS) in Vue templates. In general, we do not consider such cases to be actual vulnerabilities because there's no practical way to protect developers from the two scenarios that would allow XSS:\n\n1.  The developer is explicitly asking Vue to render user-provided, unsanitized content as Vue templates. This is inherently unsafe, and there's no way for Vue to know the origin.\n\n2.  The developer is mounting Vue to an entire HTML page which happens to contain server-rendered and user-provided content. This is fundamentally the same problem as \\#1, but sometimes devs may do it without realizing it. This can lead to possible vulnerabilities where the attacker provides HTML which is safe as plain HTML but unsafe as a Vue template. The best practice is to **never mount Vue on nodes that may contain server-rendered and user-provided content**.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nThe general rule is that if you allow unsanitized, user-provided content to be executed (as either HTML, JavaScript, or even CSS), you might open yourself up to attacks. This advice actually holds true whether using Vue, another framework, or even no framework.\n\nBeyond the recommendations made above for [Potential Dangers](#potential-dangers), we also recommend familiarizing yourself with these resources:\n\n- [HTML5 Security Cheat Sheet](https://html5sec.org/)\n- [OWASP's Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\nThen use what you learn to also review the source code of your dependencies for potentially dangerous patterns, if any of them include 3rd-party components or otherwise influence what's rendered to the DOM.\n\n## Backend Coordination\n\nHTTP security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI), are primarily addressed on the backend, so they aren't a concern of Vue's. However, it's still a good idea to communicate with your backend team to learn how to best interact with their API, e.g., by submitting CSRF tokens with form submissions.\n\n## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\nThere are some additional security concerns when using SSR, so make sure to follow the best practices outlined throughout [our SSR documentation](../scaling-up/ssr) to avoid vulnerabilities.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/security](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/security)"
- name: 42. Using Vue with TypeScript  (TypeScript)
  id: guide/typescript/overview
  summary: A type system like TypeScript can detect many common errors via static analysis at build time
  description: "# Using Vue with TypeScript\n\nA type system like TypeScript can detect many common errors via static analysis at build time. This reduces the chance of runtime errors in production, and also allows us to more confidently refactor code in large-scale applications. TypeScript also improves developer ergonomics via type-based auto-completion in IDEs.\n\nVue is written in TypeScript itself and provides first-class TypeScript support. All official Vue packages come with bundled type declarations that should work out-of-the-box.\n\n## Project Setup\n\n[`create-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), the official project scaffolding tool, offers the options to scaffold a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)-powered, TypeScript-ready Vue project.\n\n### Overview\n\nWith a Vite-based setup, the dev server and the bundler are transpilation-only and do not perform any type-checking. This ensures the Vite dev server stays blazing fast even when using TypeScript.\n\n- During development, we recommend relying on a good [IDE setup](#ide-support) for instant feedback on type errors.\n\n- If using SFCs, use the [`vue-tsc`](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc) utility for command line type checking and type declaration generation. `vue-tsc` is a wrapper around `tsc`, TypeScript's own command line interface. It works largely the same as `tsc` except that it supports Vue SFCs in addition to TypeScript files. You can run `vue-tsc` in watch mode in parallel to the Vite dev server, or use a Vite plugin like [vite-plugin-checker](https://vite-plugin-checker.netlify.app/) which runs the checks in a separate worker thread.\n\n- Vue CLI also provides TypeScript support, but is no longer recommended. See [notes below](#note-on-vue-cli-and-ts-loader).\n\n### IDE Support\n\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) is strongly recommended for its great out-of-the-box support for TypeScript.\n\n  - [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) is the official VSCode extension that provides TypeScript support inside Vue SFCs, along with many other great features.\n\n    **TIP**\n    Volar replaces [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur), our previous official VSCode extension for Vue 2. If you have Vetur currently installed, make sure to disable it in Vue 3 projects.\n\n  - [TypeScript Vue Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) is also needed to get type support for `*.vue` imports in TS files.\n\n- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) also provides out-of-the-box support for both TypeScript and Vue. Other JetBrains IDEs support them too, either out of the box or via [a free plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9442-vue-js). As of version 2023.2, WebStorm and the Vue Plugin come with built-in support for the Vue Language Server. You can set the Vue service to use Volar integration on all TypeScript versions, under Settings \\> Languages & Frameworks \\> TypeScript \\> Vue. By default, Volar will be used for TypeScript versions 5.0 and higher.\n\n### Configuring `tsconfig.json`\n\nProjects scaffolded via `create-vue` include pre-configured `tsconfig.json`. The base config is abstracted in the [`@vue/tsconfig`](https://github.com/vuejs/tsconfig) package. Inside the project, we use [Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) to ensure correct types for code running in different environments (e.g. app code and test code should have different global variables).\n\nWhen configuring `tsconfig.json` manually, some notable options include:\n\n- [`compilerOptions.isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules) is set to `true` because Vite uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for transpiling TypeScript and is subject to single-file transpile limitations. [`compilerOptions.verbatimModuleSyntax`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#verbatimModuleSyntax) is [a superset of `isolatedModules`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/53601) and is a good choice, too - it's what [`@vue/tsconfig`](https://github.com/vuejs/tsconfig) uses.\n\n- If you're using Options API, you need to set [`compilerOptions.strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) to `true` (or at least enable [`compilerOptions.noImplicitThis`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitThis), which is a part of the `strict` flag) to leverage type checking of `this` in component options. Otherwise `this` will be treated as `any`.\n\n- If you have configured resolver aliases in your build tool, for example the `@/*` alias configured by default in a `create-vue` project, you need to also configure it for TypeScript via [`compilerOptions.paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths).\n\n- If you intend to use TSX with Vue, set [`compilerOptions.jsx`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsx) to `\"preserve\"`, and set [`compilerOptions.jsxImportSource`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsxImportSource) to `\"vue\"`.\n\nSee also:\n\n- [Official TypeScript compiler options docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)\n- [esbuild TypeScript compilation caveats](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript-caveats)\n\n### Volar Takeover Mode\n\n> This section only applies for VSCode + Volar.\n\nTo get Vue SFCs and TypeScript working together, Volar creates a separate TS language service instance patched with Vue-specific support, and uses it in Vue SFCs. At the same time, plain TS files are still handled by VSCode's built-in TS language service, which is why we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to support Vue SFC imports in TS files. This default setup works, but for each project we are running two TS language service instances: one from Volar, one from VSCode's built-in service. This is a bit inefficient and can lead to performance issues in large projects.\n\nVolar provides a feature called \"Takeover Mode\" to improve performance. In takeover mode, Volar provides support for both Vue and TS files using a single TS language service instance.\n\nTo enable Takeover Mode, you need to disable VSCode's built-in TS language service in **your project's workspace only** by following these steps:\n\n1.  In your project workspace, bring up the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` (macOS: `Cmd + Shift + P`).\n2.  Type `built` and select \"Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions\".\n3.  Type `typescript` in the extension search box (do not remove `@builtin` prefix).\n4.  Click the little gear icon of \"TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features\", and select \"Disable (Workspace)\".\n5.  Reload the workspace. Takeover mode will be enabled when you open a Vue or TS file.\n\n### Note on Vue CLI and `ts-loader`\n\nIn webpack-based setups such as Vue CLI, it is common to perform type checking as part of the module transform pipeline, for example with `ts-loader`. This, however, isn't a clean solution because the type system needs knowledge of the entire module graph to perform type checks. Individual module's transform step simply is not the right place for the task. It leads to the following problems:\n\n- `ts-loader` can only type check post-transform code. This doesn't align with the errors we see in IDEs or from `vue-tsc`, which map directly back to the source code.\n\n- Type checking can be slow. When it is performed in the same thread / process with code transformations, it significantly affects the build speed of the entire application.\n\n- We already have type checking running right in our IDE in a separate process, so the cost of dev experience slow down simply isn't a good trade-off.\n\nIf you are currently using Vue 3 + TypeScript via Vue CLI, we strongly recommend migrating over to Vite. We are also working on CLI options to enable transpile-only TS support, so that you can switch to `vue-tsc` for type checking.\n\n## General Usage Notes\n\n### `defineComponent()`\n\nTo let TypeScript properly infer types inside component options, we need to define components with [`defineComponent()`](../../api/general#definecomponent):\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  // type inference enabled\n  props: {\n    name: String,\n    msg: { type: String, required: true }\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 1\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.name // type: string | undefined\n    this.msg // type: string\n    this.count // type: number\n  }\n})\n```\n\n`defineComponent()` also supports inferring the props passed to `setup()` when using Composition API without `<script setup>`:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  // type inference enabled\n  props: {\n    message: String\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    props.message // type: string | undefined\n  }\n})\n```\n\nSee also:\n\n- [Note on webpack Treeshaking](../../api/general#note-on-webpack-treeshaking)\n- [type tests for `defineComponent`](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/dts-test/defineComponent.test-d.tsx)\n\n**TIP**\n\n`defineComponent()` also enables type inference for components defined in plain JavaScript.\n\n### Usage in Single-File Components\n\nTo use TypeScript in SFCs, add the `lang=\"ts\"` attribute to `<script>` tags. When `lang=\"ts\"` is present, all template expressions also enjoy stricter type checking.\n\n``` javascript\n<script lang=\"ts\">\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- type checking and auto-completion enabled -->\n  {{ count.toFixed(2) }}\n</template>\n```\n\n`lang=\"ts\"` can also be used with `<script setup>`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n// TypeScript enabled\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(1)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- type checking and auto-completion enabled -->\n  {{ count.toFixed(2) }}\n</template>\n```\n\n### TypeScript in Templates\n\nThe `<template>` also supports TypeScript in binding expressions when `<script lang=\"ts\">` or `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` is used. This is useful in cases where you need to perform type casting in template expressions.\n\nHere's a contrived example:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nlet x: string | number = 1\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- error because x could be a string -->\n  {{ x.toFixed(2) }}\n</template>\n```\n\nThis can be worked around with an inline type cast:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nlet x: string | number = 1\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  {{ (x as number).toFixed(2) }}\n</template>\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nIf using Vue CLI or a webpack-based setup, TypeScript in template expressions requires `vue-loader@^16.8.0`.\n\n### Usage with TSX\n\nVue also supports authoring components with JSX / TSX. Details are covered in the [Render Function & JSX](../extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) guide.\n\n## Generic Components\n\nGeneric components are supported in two cases:\n\n- In SFCs: [`<script setup>` with the `generic` attribute](../../api/sfc-script-setup#generics)\n- Render function / JSX components: [`defineComponent()`'s function signature](../../api/general#function-signature)\n\n## API-Specific Recipes\n\n- [TS with Composition API](composition-api)\n- [TS with Options API](options-api)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview)"

  summary: This page assumes you've already read the overview on Using Vue with TypeScript
  description: "# TypeScript with Composition API\n\n> This page assumes you've already read the overview on [Using Vue with TypeScript](overview).\n\n## Typing Component Props\n\n### Using `<script setup>`\n\nWhen using `<script setup>`, the `defineProps()` macro supports inferring the props types based on its argument:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nconst props = defineProps({\n  foo: { type: String, required: true },\n  bar: Number\n})\n\nprops.foo // string\nprops.bar // number | undefined\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is called \"runtime declaration\", because the argument passed to `defineProps()` will be used as the runtime `props` option.\n\nHowever, it is usually more straightforward to define props with pure types via a generic type argument:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  foo: string\n  bar?: number\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is called \"type-based declaration\". The compiler will try to do its best to infer the equivalent runtime options based on the type argument. In this case, our second example compiles into the exact same runtime options as the first example.\n\nYou can use either type-based declaration OR runtime declaration, but you cannot use both at the same time.\n\nWe can also move the props types into a separate interface:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  foo: string\n  bar?: number\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n```\n\nThis also works if `Props` is imported from an external source. This feature requires TypeScript to be a peer dependency of Vue.\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport type { Props } from './foo'\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n```\n\n#### Syntax Limitations\n\nIn version 3.2 and below, the generic type parameter for `defineProps()` were limited to a type literal or a reference to a local interface.\n\nThis limitation has been resolved in 3.3. The latest version of Vue supports referencing imported and a limited set of complex types in the type parameter position. However, because the type to runtime conversion is still AST-based, some complex types that require actual type analysis, e.g. conditional types, are not supported. You can use conditional types for the type of a single prop, but not the entire props object.\n\n### Props Default Values\n\nWhen using type-based declaration, we lose the ability to declare default values for the props. This can be resolved by the `withDefaults` compiler macro:\n\n``` ts\nexport interface Props {\n  msg?: string\n  labels?: string[]\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  msg: 'hello',\n  labels: () => ['one', 'two']\n})\n```\n\nThis will be compiled to equivalent runtime props `default` options. In addition, the `withDefaults` helper provides type checks for the default values, and ensures the returned `props` type has the optional flags removed for properties that do have default values declared.\n\n### Without `<script setup>`\n\nIf not using `<script setup>`, it is necessary to use `defineComponent()` to enable props type inference. The type of the props object passed to `setup()` is inferred from the `props` option.\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    message: String\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    props.message // <-- type: string\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Complex prop types\n\nWith type-based declaration, a prop can use a complex type much like any other type:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  author: string\n  year: number\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  book: Book\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\nFor runtime declaration, we can use the `PropType` utility type:\n\n``` ts\nimport type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\nconst props = defineProps({\n  book: Object as PropType<Book>\n})\n```\n\nThis works in much the same way if we're specifying the `props` option directly:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\nimport type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    book: Object as PropType<Book>\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe `props` option is more commonly used with the Options API, so you'll find more detailed examples in the guide to [TypeScript with Options API](options-api#typing-component-props). The techniques shown in those examples also apply to runtime declarations using `defineProps()`.\n\n## Typing Component Emits\n\nIn `<script setup>`, the `emit` function can also be typed using either runtime declaration OR type declaration:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n// runtime\nconst emit = defineEmits(['change', 'update'])\n\n// options based\nconst emit = defineEmits({\n  change: (id: number) => {\n    // return `true` or `false` to indicate\n    // validation pass / fail\n  },\n  update: (value: string) => {\n    // return `true` or `false` to indicate\n    // validation pass / fail\n  }\n})\n\n// type-based\nconst emit = defineEmits<{\n  (e: 'change', id: number): void\n  (e: 'update', value: string): void\n}>()\n\n// 3.3+: alternative, more succinct syntax\nconst emit = defineEmits<{\n  change: [id: number]\n  update: [value: string]\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\nThe type argument can be one of the following:\n\n1.  A callable function type, but written as a type literal with [Call Signatures](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#call-signatures). It will be used as the type of the returned `emit` function.\n2.  A type literal where the keys are the event names, and values are array / tuple types representing the additional accepted parameters for the event. The example above is using named tuples so each argument can have an explicit name.\n\nAs we can see, the type declaration gives us much finer-grained control over the type constraints of emitted events.\n\nWhen not using `<script setup>`, `defineComponent()` is able to infer the allowed events for the `emit` function exposed on the setup context:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  emits: ['change'],\n  setup(props, { emit }) {\n    emit('change') // <-- type check / auto-completion\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Typing `ref()`\n\nRefs infer the type from the initial value:\n\n``` ts\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\n// inferred type: Ref<number>\nconst year = ref(2020)\n\n// => TS Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.\nyear.value = '2020'\n```\n\nSometimes we may need to specify complex types for a ref's inner value. We can do that by using the `Ref` type:\n\n``` ts\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nimport type { Ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst year: Ref<string | number> = ref('2020')\n\nyear.value = 2020 // ok!\n```\n\nOr, by passing a generic argument when calling `ref()` to override the default inference:\n\n``` ts\n// resulting type: Ref<string | number>\nconst year = ref<string | number>('2020')\n\nyear.value = 2020 // ok!\n```\n\nIf you specify a generic type argument but omit the initial value, the resulting type will be a union type that includes `undefined`:\n\n``` ts\n// inferred type: Ref<number | undefined>\nconst n = ref<number>()\n```\n\n## Typing `reactive()`\n\n`reactive()` also implicitly infers the type from its argument:\n\n``` ts\nimport { reactive } from 'vue'\n\n// inferred type: { title: string }\nconst book = reactive({ title: 'Vue 3 Guide' })\n```\n\nTo explicitly type a `reactive` property, we can use interfaces:\n\n``` ts\nimport { reactive } from 'vue'\n\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  year?: number\n}\n\nconst book: Book = reactive({ title: 'Vue 3 Guide' })\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nIt's not recommended to use the generic argument of `reactive()` because the returned type, which handles nested ref unwrapping, is different from the generic argument type.\n\n## Typing `computed()`\n\n`computed()` infers its type based on the getter's return value:\n\n``` ts\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n\n// inferred type: ComputedRef<number>\nconst double = computed(() => count.value * 2)\n\n// => TS Error: Property 'split' does not exist on type 'number'\nconst result = double.value.split('')\n```\n\nYou can also specify an explicit type via a generic argument:\n\n``` ts\nconst double = computed<number>(() => {\n  // type error if this doesn't return a number\n})\n```\n\n## Typing Event Handlers\n\nWhen dealing with native DOM events, it might be useful to type the argument we pass to the handler correctly. Let's take a look at this example:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nfunction handleChange(event) {\n  // `event` implicitly has `any` type\n  console.log(event.target.value)\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" @change=\"handleChange\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nWithout type annotation, the `event` argument will implicitly have a type of `any`. This will also result in a TS error if `\"strict\": true` or `\"noImplicitAny\": true` are used in `tsconfig.json`. It is therefore recommended to explicitly annotate the argument of event handlers. In addition, you may need to use type assertions when accessing the properties of `event`:\n\n``` ts\nfunction handleChange(event: Event) {\n  console.log((event.target as HTMLInputElement).value)\n}\n```\n\n## Typing Provide / Inject\n\nProvide and inject are usually performed in separate components. To properly type injected values, Vue provides an `InjectionKey` interface, which is a generic type that extends `Symbol`. It can be used to sync the type of the injected value between the provider and the consumer:\n\n``` ts\nimport { provide, inject } from 'vue'\nimport type { InjectionKey } from 'vue'\n\nconst key = Symbol() as InjectionKey<string>\n\nprovide(key, 'foo') // providing non-string value will result in error\n\nconst foo = inject(key) // type of foo: string | undefined\n```\n\nIt's recommended to place the injection key in a separate file so that it can be imported in multiple components.\n\nWhen using string injection keys, the type of the injected value will be `unknown`, and needs to be explicitly declared via a generic type argument:\n\n``` ts\nconst foo = inject<string>('foo') // type: string | undefined\n```\n\nNotice the injected value can still be `undefined`, because there is no guarantee that a provider will provide this value at runtime.\n\nThe `undefined` type can be removed by providing a default value:\n\n``` ts\nconst foo = inject<string>('foo', 'bar') // type: string\n```\n\nIf you are sure that the value is always provided, you can also force cast the value:\n\n``` ts\nconst foo = inject('foo') as string\n```\n\n## Typing Template Refs\n\nTemplate refs should be created with an explicit generic type argument and an initial value of `null`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\nconst el = ref<HTMLInputElement | null>(null)\n\nonMounted(() => {\n  el.value?.focus()\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input ref=\"el\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nTo get the right DOM interface you can check pages like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#technical_summary).\n\nNote that for strict type safety, it is necessary to use optional chaining or type guards when accessing `el.value`. This is because the initial ref value is `null` until the component is mounted, and it can also be set to `null` if the referenced element is unmounted by `v-if`.\n\n## Typing Component Template Refs\n\nSometimes you might need to annotate a template ref for a child component in order to call its public method. For example, we have a `MyModal` child component with a method that opens the modal:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- MyModal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isContentShown = ref(false)\nconst open = () => (isContentShown.value = true)\n\ndefineExpose({\n  open\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nIn order to get the instance type of `MyModal`, we need to first get its type via `typeof`, then use TypeScript's built-in `InstanceType` utility to extract its instance type:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- App.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport MyModal from './MyModal.vue'\n\nconst modal = ref<InstanceType<typeof MyModal> | null>(null)\n\nconst openModal = () => {\n  modal.value?.open()\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nNote if you want to use this technique in TypeScript files instead of Vue SFCs, you need to enable Volar's [Takeover Mode](overview#volar-takeover-mode).\n\nIn cases where the exact type of the component isn't available or isn't important, `ComponentPublicInstance` can be used instead. This will only include properties that are shared by all components, such as `$el`:\n\n``` ts\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nimport type { ComponentPublicInstance } from 'vue'\n\nconst child = ref<ComponentPublicInstance | null>(null)\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api)"

  summary: This page assumes you've already read the overview on Using Vue with TypeScript
  description: "# TypeScript with Options API\n\n> This page assumes you've already read the overview on [Using Vue with TypeScript](overview).\n\n**TIP**\n\nWhile Vue does support TypeScript usage with Options API, it is recommended to use Vue with TypeScript via Composition API as it offers simpler, more efficient and more robust type inference.\n\n## Typing Component Props\n\nType inference for props in Options API requires wrapping the component with `defineComponent()`. With it, Vue is able to infer the types for the props based on the `props` option, taking additional options such as `required: true` and `default` into account:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  // type inference enabled\n  props: {\n    name: String,\n    id: [Number, String],\n    msg: { type: String, required: true },\n    metadata: null\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.name // type: string | undefined\n    this.id // type: number | string | undefined\n    this.msg // type: string\n    this.metadata // type: any\n  }\n})\n```\n\nHowever, the runtime `props` options only support using constructor functions as a prop's type - there is no way to specify complex types such as objects with nested properties or function call signatures.\n\nTo annotate complex props types, we can use the `PropType` utility type:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\nimport type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  author: string\n  year: number\n}\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    book: {\n      // provide more specific type to `Object`\n      type: Object as PropType<Book>,\n      required: true\n    },\n    // can also annotate functions\n    callback: Function as PropType<(id: number) => void>\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.book.title // string\n    this.book.year // number\n\n    // TS Error: argument of type 'string' is not\n    // assignable to parameter of type 'number'\n    this.callback?.('123')\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Caveats\n\nIf your TypeScript version is less than `4.7`, you have to be careful when using function values for `validator` and `default` prop options - make sure to use arrow functions:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\nimport type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  year?: number\n}\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    bookA: {\n      type: Object as PropType<Book>,\n      // Make sure to use arrow functions if your TypeScript version is less than 4.7\n      default: () => ({\n        title: 'Arrow Function Expression'\n      }),\n      validator: (book: Book) => !!book.title\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis prevents TypeScript from having to infer the type of `this` inside these functions, which, unfortunately, can cause the type inference to fail. It was a previous [design limitation](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38845), and now has been improved in [TypeScript 4.7](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-7.html#improved-function-inference-in-objects-and-methods).\n\n## Typing Component Emits\n\nWe can declare the expected payload type for an emitted event using the object syntax of the `emits` option. Also, all non-declared emitted events will throw a type error when called:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  emits: {\n    addBook(payload: { bookName: string }) {\n      // perform runtime validation\n      return payload.bookName.length > 0\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    onSubmit() {\n      this.$emit('addBook', {\n        bookName: 123 // Type error!\n      })\n\n      this.$emit('non-declared-event') // Type error!\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Typing Computed Properties\n\nA computed property infers its type based on its return value:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello!'\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    greeting() {\n      return this.message + '!'\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.greeting // type: string\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIn some cases, you may want to explicitly annotate the type of a computed property to ensure its implementation is correct:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello!'\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    // explicitly annotate return type\n    greeting(): string {\n      return this.message + '!'\n    },\n\n    // annotating a writable computed property\n    greetingUppercased: {\n      get(): string {\n        return this.greeting.toUpperCase()\n      },\n      set(newValue: string) {\n        this.message = newValue.toUpperCase()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nExplicit annotations may also be required in some edge cases where TypeScript fails to infer the type of a computed property due to circular inference loops.\n\n## Typing Event Handlers\n\nWhen dealing with native DOM events, it might be useful to type the argument we pass to the handler correctly. Let's take a look at this example:\n\n``` javascript\n<script lang=\"ts\">\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  methods: {\n    handleChange(event) {\n      // `event` implicitly has `any` type\n      console.log(event.target.value)\n    }\n  }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input type=\"text\" @change=\"handleChange\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nWithout type annotation, the `event` argument will implicitly have a type of `any`. This will also result in a TS error if `\"strict\": true` or `\"noImplicitAny\": true` are used in `tsconfig.json`. It is therefore recommended to explicitly annotate the argument of event handlers. In addition, you may need to use type assertions when accessing the properties of `event`:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  methods: {\n    handleChange(event: Event) {\n      console.log((event.target as HTMLInputElement).value)\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Augmenting Global Properties\n\nSome plugins install globally available properties to all component instances via [`app.config.globalProperties`](../../api/application#app-config-globalproperties). For example, we may install `this.$http` for data-fetching or `this.$translate` for internationalization. To make this play well with TypeScript, Vue exposes a `ComponentCustomProperties` interface designed to be augmented via [TypeScript module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation):\n\n``` ts\nimport axios from 'axios'\n\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties {\n    $http: typeof axios\n    $translate: (key: string) => string\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSee also:\n\n- [TypeScript unit tests for component type extensions](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/dts-test/componentTypeExtensions.test-d.tsx)\n\n### Type Augmentation Placement\n\nWe can put this type augmentation in a `.ts` file, or in a project-wide `*.d.ts` file. Either way, make sure it is included in `tsconfig.json`. For library / plugin authors, this file should be specified in the `types` property in `package.json`.\n\nIn order to take advantage of module augmentation, you will need to ensure the augmentation is placed in a [TypeScript module](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html). That is to say, the file needs to contain at least one top-level `import` or `export`, even if it is just `export {}`. If the augmentation is placed outside of a module, it will overwrite the original types rather than augmenting them!\n\n``` ts\n// Does not work, overwrites the original types.\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties {\n    $translate: (key: string) => string\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` ts\n// Works correctly\nexport {}\n\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties {\n    $translate: (key: string) => string\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Augmenting Custom Options\n\nSome plugins, for example `vue-router`, provide support for custom component options such as `beforeRouteEnter`:\n\n``` ts\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  beforeRouteEnter(to, from, next) {\n    // ...\n  }\n})\n```\n\nWithout proper type augmentation, the arguments of this hook will implicitly have `any` type. We can augment the `ComponentCustomOptions` interface to support these custom options:\n\n``` ts\nimport { Route } from 'vue-router'\n\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomOptions {\n    beforeRouteEnter?(to: Route, from: Route, next: () => void): void\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow the `beforeRouteEnter` option will be properly typed. Note this is just an example - well-typed libraries like `vue-router` should automatically perform these augmentations in their own type definitions.\n\nThe placement of this augmentation is subject the [same restrictions](#type-augmentation-placement) as global property augmentations.\n\nSee also:\n\n- [TypeScript unit tests for component type extensions](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/dts-test/componentTypeExtensions.test-d.tsx)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/options-api](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/options-api)"

  summary: We believe there is no "one size fits all" story for the web
  description: "# Ways of Using Vue\n\nWe believe there is no \"one size fits all\" story for the web. This is why Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways to strike the optimal balance between stack complexity, developer experience and end performance.\n\n## Standalone Script\n\nVue can be used as a standalone script file - no build step required! If you have a backend framework already rendering most of the HTML, or your frontend logic isn't complex enough to justify a build step, this is the easiest way to integrate Vue into your stack. You can think of Vue as a more declarative replacement of jQuery in such cases.\n\nVue also provides an alternative distribution called [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) that is specifically optimized for progressively enhancing existing HTML. It has a smaller feature set, but is extremely lightweight and uses an implementation that is more efficient in no-build-step scenarios.\n\n## Embedded Web Components\n\nYou can use Vue to [build standard Web Components](web-components) that can be embedded in any HTML page, regardless of how they are rendered. This option allows you to leverage Vue in a completely consumer-agnostic fashion: the resulting web components can be embedded in legacy applications, static HTML, or even applications built with other frameworks.\n\n## Single-Page Application (SPA)\n\nSome applications require rich interactivity, deep session depth, and non-trivial stateful logic on the frontend. The best way to build such applications is to use an architecture where Vue not only controls the entire page, but also handles data updates and navigation without having to reload the page. This type of application is typically referred to as a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n\nVue provides core libraries and [comprehensive tooling support](../scaling-up/tooling) with amazing developer experience for building modern SPAs, including:\n\n- Client-side router\n- Blazing fast build tool chain\n- IDE support\n- Browser devtools\n- TypeScript integrations\n- Testing utilities\n\nSPAs typically require the backend to expose API endpoints - but you can also pair Vue with solutions like [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) to get the SPA benefits while retaining a server-centric development model.\n\n## Fullstack / SSR\n\nPure client-side SPAs are problematic when the app is sensitive to SEO and time-to-content. This is because the browser will receive a largely empty HTML page, and has to wait until the JavaScript is loaded before rendering anything.\n\nVue provides first-class APIs to \"render\" a Vue app into HTML strings on the server. This allows the server to send back already-rendered HTML, allowing end users to see the content immediately while the JavaScript is being downloaded. Vue will then \"hydrate\" the application on the client side to make it interactive. This is called [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](../scaling-up/ssr) and it greatly improves Core Web Vital metrics such as [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/).\n\nThere are higher-level Vue-based frameworks built on top of this paradigm, such as [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), which allow you to develop a fullstack application using Vue and JavaScript.\n\n## JAMStack / SSG\n\nServer-side rendering can be done ahead of time if the required data is static. This means we can pre-render an entire application into HTML and serve them as static files. This improves site performance and makes deployment a lot simpler since we no longer need to dynamically render pages on each request. Vue can still hydrate such applications to provide rich interactivity on the client. This technique is commonly referred to as Static-Site Generation (SSG), also known as [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/).\n\nThere are two flavors of SSG: single-page and multi-page. Both flavors pre-render the site into static HTML, the difference is that:\n\n- After the initial page load, a single-page SSG \"hydrates\" the page into an SPA. This requires more upfront JS payload and hydration cost, but subsequent navigations will be faster, since it only needs to partially update the page content instead of reloading the entire page.\n\n- A multi-page SSG loads a new page on every navigation. The upside is that it can ship minimal JS - or no JS at all if the page requires no interaction! Some multi-page SSG frameworks such as [Astro](https://astro.build/) also support \"partial hydration\" - which allows you to use Vue components to create interactive \"islands\" inside static HTML.\n\nSingle-page SSGs are better suited if you expect non-trivial interactivity, deep session lengths, or persisted elements / state across navigations. Otherwise, multi-page SSG would be the better choice.\n\nThe Vue team also maintains a static-site generator called [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), which powers this website you are reading right now! VitePress supports both flavors of SSG. [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) also supports SSG. You can even mix SSR and SSG for different routes in the same Nuxt app.\n\n## Beyond the Web\n\nAlthough Vue is primarily designed for building web applications, it is by no means limited to just the browser. You can:\n\n- Build desktop apps with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) or [Tauri](https://tauri.app)\n- Build mobile apps with [Ionic Vue](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/overview)\n- Build desktop and mobile apps from the same codebase with [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)\n- Use Vue's [Custom Renderer API](../../api/custom-renderer) to build custom renderers targeting [WebGL](https://troisjs.github.io/) or even [the terminal](https://github.com/vue-terminal/vue-termui)!\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue)"

  summary: This FAQ assumes prior experience with Vue - in particular, experience with Vue 2 while primarily using Options API
  description: "# Composition API FAQ\n\n**TIP**\n\nThis FAQ assumes prior experience with Vue - in particular, experience with Vue 2 while primarily using Options API.\n\n## What is Composition API?\n\nComposition API is a set of APIs that allows us to author Vue components using imported functions instead of declaring options. It is an umbrella term that covers the following APIs:\n\n- [Reactivity API](../../api/reactivity-core), e.g. `ref()` and `reactive()`, that allows us to directly create reactive state, computed state, and watchers.\n\n- [Lifecycle Hooks](../../api/composition-api-lifecycle), e.g. `onMounted()` and `onUnmounted()`, that allow us to programmatically hook into the component lifecycle.\n\n- [Dependency Injection](../../api/composition-api-dependency-injection), i.e. `provide()` and `inject()`, that allow us to leverage Vue's dependency injection system while using Reactivity APIs.\n\nComposition API is a built-in feature of Vue 3 and [Vue 2.7](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-7-naruto.html). For older Vue 2 versions, use the officially maintained [`@vue/composition-api`](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) plugin. In Vue 3, it is also primarily used together with the [`<script setup>`](../../api/sfc-script-setup) syntax in Single-File Components. Here's a basic example of a component using Composition API:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\n// reactive state\nconst count = ref(0)\n\n// functions that mutate state and trigger updates\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}\n\n// lifecycle hooks\nonMounted(() => {\n  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">Count is: {{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\nDespite an API style based on function composition, **Composition API is NOT functional programming**. Composition API is based on Vue's mutable, fine-grained reactivity paradigm, whereas functional programming emphasizes immutability.\n\nIf you are interested in learning how to use Vue with Composition API, you can set the site-wide API preference to Composition API using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar, and then go through the guide from the beginning.\n\n## Why Composition API?\n\n### Better Logic Reuse\n\nThe primary advantage of Composition API is that it enables clean, efficient logic reuse in the form of [Composable functions](../reusability/composables). It solves [all the drawbacks of mixins](../reusability/composables#vs-mixins), the primary logic reuse mechanism for Options API.\n\nComposition API's logic reuse capability has given rise to impressive community projects such as [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/), an ever-growing collection of composable utilities. It also serves as a clean mechanism for easily integrating stateful third-party services or libraries into Vue's reactivity system, for example [immutable data](reactivity-in-depth#immutable-data), [state machines](reactivity-in-depth#state-machines), and [RxJS](reactivity-in-depth#rxjs).\n\n### More Flexible Code Organization\n\nMany users love that we write organized code by default with Options API: everything has its place based on the option it falls under. However, Options API poses serious limitations when a single component's logic grows beyond a certain complexity threshold. This limitation is particularly prominent in components that need to deal with multiple **logical concerns**, which we have witnessed first hand in many production Vue 2 apps.\n\nTake the folder explorer component from Vue CLI's GUI as an example: this component is responsible for the following logical concerns:\n\n- Tracking current folder state and displaying its content\n- Handling folder navigation (opening, closing, refreshing...)\n- Handling new folder creation\n- Toggling show favorite folders only\n- Toggling show hidden folders\n- Handling current working directory changes\n\nThe [original version](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/a09407dd5b9f18ace7501ddb603b95e31d6d93c0/packages/@vue/cli-ui/src/components/folder/FolderExplorer.vue#L198-L404) of the component was written in Options API. If we give each line of code a color based on the logical concern it is dealing with, this is how it looks:\n\nNotice how code dealing with the same logical concern is forced to be split under different options, located in different parts of the file. In a component that is several hundred lines long, understanding and navigating a single logical concern requires constantly scrolling up and down the file, making it much more difficult than it should be. In addition, if we ever intend to extract a logical concern into a reusable utility, it takes quite a bit of work to find and extract the right pieces of code from different parts of the file.\n\nHere's the same component, before and after the [refactor into Composition API](https://gist.github.com/yyx990803/8854f8f6a97631576c14b63c8acd8f2e):\n\nNotice how the code related to the same logical concern can now be grouped together: we no longer need to jump between different options blocks while working on a specific logical concern. Moreover, we can now move a group of code into an external file with minimal effort, since we no longer need to shuffle the code around in order to extract them. This reduced friction for refactoring is key to the long-term maintainability in large codebases.\n\n### Better Type Inference\n\nIn recent years, more and more frontend developers are adopting [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as it helps us write more robust code, make changes with more confidence, and provides a great development experience with IDE support. However, the Options API, originally conceived in 2013, was designed without type inference in mind. We had to implement some [absurdly complex type gymnastics](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/44b95276f5c086e1d88fa3c686a5f39eb5bb7821/packages/runtime-core/src/componentPublicInstance.ts#L132-L165) to make type inference work with the Options API. Even with all this effort, type inference for Options API can still break down for mixins and dependency injection.\n\nThis had led many developers who wanted to use Vue with TS to lean towards Class API powered by `vue-class-component`. However, a class-based API heavily relies on ES decorators, a language feature that was only a stage 2 proposal when Vue 3 was being developed in 2019. We felt it was too risky to base an official API on an unstable proposal. Since then, the decorators proposal has gone through yet another complete overhaul, and finally reached stage 3 in 2022. In addition, class-based API suffers from logic reuse and organization limitations similar to Options API.\n\nIn comparison, Composition API utilizes mostly plain variables and functions, which are naturally type friendly. Code written in Composition API can enjoy full type inference with little need for manual type hints. Most of the time, Composition API code will look largely identical in TypeScript and plain JavaScript. This also makes it possible for plain JavaScript users to benefit from partial type inference.\n\n### Smaller Production Bundle and Less Overhead\n\nCode written in Composition API and `<script setup>` is also more efficient and minification-friendly than Options API equivalent. This is because the template in a `<script setup>` component is compiled as a function inlined in the same scope of the `<script setup>` code. Unlike property access from `this`, the compiled template code can directly access variables declared inside `<script setup>`, without an instance proxy in between. This also leads to better minification because all the variable names can be safely shortened.\n\n## Relationship with Options API\n\n### Trade-offs\n\nSome users moving from Options API found their Composition API code less organized, and concluded that Composition API is \"worse\" in terms of code organization. We recommend users with such opinions to look at that problem from a different perspective.\n\nIt is true that Composition API no longer provides the \"guard rails\" that guide you to put your code into respective buckets. In return, you get to author component code like how you would write normal JavaScript. This means **you can and should apply any code organization best practices to your Composition API code as you would when writing normal JavaScript**. If you can write well-organized JavaScript, you should also be able to write well-organized Composition API code.\n\nOptions API does allow you to \"think less\" when writing component code, which is why many users love it. However, in reducing the mental overhead, it also locks you into the prescribed code organization pattern with no escape hatch, which can make it difficult to refactor or improve code quality in larger scale projects. In this regard, Composition API provides better long term scalability.\n\n### Does Composition API cover all use cases?\n\nYes in terms of stateful logic. When using Composition API, there are only a few options that may still be needed: `props`, `emits`, `name`, and `inheritAttrs`.\n\n**TIP**\n\nSince 3.3 you can directly use `defineOptions` in `<script setup>` to set the component name or `inheritAttrs` property\n\nIf you intend to exclusively use Composition API (along with the options listed above), you can shave a few kbs off your production bundle via a [compile-time flag](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#bundler-build-feature-flags) that drops Options API related code from Vue. Note this also affects Vue components in your dependencies.\n\n### Can I use both APIs in the same component?\n\nYes. You can use Composition API via the [`setup()`](../../api/composition-api-setup) option in an Options API component.\n\nHowever, we only recommend doing so if you have an existing Options API codebase that needs to integrate with new features / external libraries written with Composition API.\n\n### Will Options API be deprecated?\n\nNo, we do not have any plan to do so. Options API is an integral part of Vue and the reason many developers love it. We also realize that many of the benefits of Composition API only manifest in larger-scale projects, and Options API remains a solid choice for many low-to-medium-complexity scenarios.\n\n## Relationship with Class API\n\nWe no longer recommend using Class API with Vue 3, given that Composition API provides great TypeScript integration with additional logic reuse and code organization benefits.\n\n## Comparison with React Hooks\n\nComposition API provides the same level of logic composition capabilities as React Hooks, but with some important differences.\n\nReact Hooks are invoked repeatedly every time a component updates. This creates a number of caveats that can confuse even seasoned React developers. It also leads to performance optimization issues that can severely affect development experience. Here are some examples:\n\n- Hooks are call-order sensitive and cannot be conditional.\n\n- Variables declared in a React component can be captured by a hook closure and become \"stale\" if the developer fails to pass in the correct dependencies array. This leads to React developers relying on ESLint rules to ensure correct dependencies are passed. However, the rule is often not smart enough and over-compensates for correctness, which leads to unnecessary invalidation and headaches when edge cases are encountered.\n\n- Expensive computations require the use of `useMemo`, which again requires manually passing in the correct dependencies array.\n\n- Event handlers passed to child components cause unnecessary child updates by default, and require explicit `useCallback` as an optimization. This is almost always needed, and again requires a correct dependencies array. Neglecting this leads to over-rendering apps by default and can cause performance issues without realizing it.\n\n- The stale closure problem, combined with Concurrent features, makes it difficult to reason about when a piece of hooks code is run, and makes working with mutable state that should persist across renders (via `useRef`) cumbersome.\n\nIn comparison, Vue Composition API:\n\n- Invokes `setup()` or `<script setup>` code only once. This makes the code align better with the intuitions of idiomatic JavaScript usage as there are no stale closures to worry about. Composition API calls are also not sensitive to call order and can be conditional.\n\n- Vue's runtime reactivity system automatically collects reactive dependencies used in computed properties and watchers, so there's no need to manually declare dependencies.\n\n- No need to manually cache callback functions to avoid unnecessary child updates. In general, Vue's fine-grained reactivity system ensures child components only update when they need to. Manual child-update optimizations are rarely a concern for Vue developers.\n\nWe acknowledge the creativity of React Hooks, and it is a major source of inspiration for Composition API. However, the issues mentioned above do exist in its design and we noticed Vue's reactivity model happens to provide a way around them.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq)"

  summary: One of Vue’s most distinctive features is the unobtrusive reactivity system
  description: "# Reactivity in Depth\n\nOne of Vue’s most distinctive features is the unobtrusive reactivity system. Component state consists of reactive JavaScript objects. When you modify them, the view updates. It makes state management simple and intuitive, but it’s also important to understand how it works to avoid some common gotchas. In this section, we are going to dig into some of the lower-level details of Vue’s reactivity system.\n\n## What is Reactivity?\n\nThis term comes up in programming quite a bit these days, but what do people mean when they say it? Reactivity is a programming paradigm that allows us to adjust to changes in a declarative manner. The canonical example that people usually show, because it’s a great one, is an Excel spreadsheet:\n\n[TABLE]\n\nHere cell A2 is defined via a formula of `= A0 + A1` (you can click on A2 to view or edit the formula), so the spreadsheet gives us 3. No surprises there. But if you update A0 or A1, you'll notice that A2 automagically updates too.\n\nJavaScript doesn’t usually work like this. If we were to write something comparable in JavaScript:\n\n``` js\nlet A0 = 1\nlet A1 = 2\nlet A2 = A0 + A1\n\nconsole.log(A2) // 3\n\nA0 = 2\nconsole.log(A2) // Still 3\n```\n\nWhen we mutate `A0`, `A2` does not change automatically.\n\nSo how would we do this in JavaScript? First, in order to re-run the code that updates `A2`, let's wrap it in a function:\n\n``` js\nlet A2\n\nfunction update() {\n  A2 = A0 + A1\n}\n```\n\nThen, we need to define a few terms:\n\n- The `update()` function produces a **side effect**, or **effect** for short, because it modifies the state of the program.\n\n- `A0` and `A1` are considered **dependencies** of the effect, as their values are used to perform the effect. The effect is said to be a **subscriber** to its dependencies.\n\nWhat we need is a magic function that can invoke `update()` (the **effect**) whenever `A0` or `A1` (the **dependencies**) change:\n\n``` js\nwhenDepsChange(update)\n```\n\nThis `whenDepsChange()` function has the following tasks:\n\n1.  Track when a variable is read. E.g. when evaluating the expression `A0 + A1`, both `A0` and `A1` are read.\n\n2.  If a variable is read when there is a currently running effect, make that effect a subscriber to that variable. E.g. because `A0` and `A1` are read when `update()` is being executed, `update()` becomes a subscriber to both `A0` and `A1` after the first call.\n\n3.  Detect when a variable is mutated. E.g. when `A0` is assigned a new value, notify all its subscriber effects to re-run.\n\n## How Reactivity Works in Vue\n\nWe can't really track the reading and writing of local variables like in the example. There's just no mechanism for doing that in vanilla JavaScript. What we **can** do though, is intercept the reading and writing of **object properties**.\n\nThere are two ways of intercepting property access in JavaScript: [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) / [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) and [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). Vue 2 used getter / setters exclusively due to browser support limitations. In Vue 3, Proxies are used for reactive objects and getter / setters are used for refs. Here's some pseudo-code that illustrates how they work:\n\n``` js\nfunction reactive(obj) {\n  return new Proxy(obj, {\n    get(target, key) {\n      track(target, key)\n      return target[key]\n    },\n    set(target, key, value) {\n      target[key] = value\n      trigger(target, key)\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nfunction ref(value) {\n  const refObject = {\n    get value() {\n      track(refObject, 'value')\n      return value\n    },\n    set value(newValue) {\n      value = newValue\n      trigger(refObject, 'value')\n    }\n  }\n  return refObject\n}\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nCode snippets here and below are meant to explain the core concepts in the simplest form possible, so many details are omitted, and edge cases ignored.\n\nThis explains a few [limitations of reactive objects](../essentials/reactivity-fundamentals#limitations-of-reactive) that we have discussed in the fundamentals section:\n\n- When you assign or destructure a reactive object's property to a local variable, accessing or assigning to that variable is non-reactive because it no longer triggers the get / set proxy traps on the source object. Note this \"disconnect\" only affects the variable binding - if the variable points to a non-primitive value such as an object, mutating the object would still be reactive.\n\n- The returned proxy from `reactive()`, although behaving just like the original, has a different identity if we compare it to the original using the `===` operator.\n\nInside `track()`, we check whether there is a currently running effect. If there is one, we lookup the subscriber effects (stored in a Set) for the property being tracked, and add the effect to the Set:\n\n``` js\n// This will be set right before an effect is about\n// to be run. We'll deal with this later.\nlet activeEffect\n\nfunction track(target, key) {\n  if (activeEffect) {\n    const effects = getSubscribersForProperty(target, key)\n    effects.add(activeEffect)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEffect subscriptions are stored in a global `WeakMap<target, Map<key, Set<effect>>>` data structure. If no subscribing effects Set was found for a property (tracked for the first time), it will be created. This is what the `getSubscribersForProperty()` function does, in short. For simplicity, we will skip its details.\n\nInside `trigger()`, we again lookup the subscriber effects for the property. But this time we invoke them instead:\n\n``` js\nfunction trigger(target, key) {\n  const effects = getSubscribersForProperty(target, key)\n  effects.forEach((effect) => effect())\n}\n```\n\nNow let's circle back to the `whenDepsChange()` function:\n\n``` js\nfunction whenDepsChange(update) {\n  const effect = () => {\n    activeEffect = effect\n    update()\n    activeEffect = null\n  }\n  effect()\n}\n```\n\nIt wraps the raw `update` function in an effect that sets itself as the current active effect before running the actual update. This enables `track()` calls during the update to locate the current active effect.\n\nAt this point, we have created an effect that automatically tracks its dependencies, and re-runs whenever a dependency changes. We call this a **Reactive Effect**.\n\nVue provides an API that allows you to create reactive effects: [`watchEffect()`](../../api/reactivity-core#watcheffect). In fact, you may have noticed that it works pretty similarly to the magical `whenDepsChange()` in the example. We can now rework the original example using actual Vue APIs:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref, watchEffect } from 'vue'\n\nconst A0 = ref(0)\nconst A1 = ref(1)\nconst A2 = ref()\n\nwatchEffect(() => {\n  // tracks A0 and A1\n  A2.value = A0.value + A1.value\n})\n\n// triggers the effect\nA0.value = 2\n```\n\nUsing a reactive effect to mutate a ref isn't the most interesting use case - in fact, using a computed property makes it more declarative:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst A0 = ref(0)\nconst A1 = ref(1)\nconst A2 = computed(() => A0.value + A1.value)\n\nA0.value = 2\n```\n\nInternally, `computed` manages its invalidation and re-computation using a reactive effect.\n\nSo what's an example of a common and useful reactive effect? Well, updating the DOM! We can implement simple \"reactive rendering\" like this:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref, watchEffect } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n\nwatchEffect(() => {\n  document.body.innerHTML = `count is: ${count.value}`\n})\n\n// updates the DOM\ncount.value++\n```\n\nIn fact, this is pretty close to how a Vue component keeps the state and the DOM in sync - each component instance creates a reactive effect to render and update the DOM. Of course, Vue components use much more efficient ways to update the DOM than `innerHTML`. This is discussed in [Rendering Mechanism](rendering-mechanism).\n\nThe `ref()`, `computed()` and `watchEffect()` APIs are all part of the Composition API. If you have only been using Options API with Vue so far, you'll notice that Composition API is closer to how Vue's reactivity system works under the hood. In fact, in Vue 3 the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API. All property access on the component instance (`this`) triggers getter / setters for reactivity tracking, and options like `watch` and `computed` invoke their Composition API equivalents internally.\n\n## Runtime vs. Compile-time Reactivity\n\nVue's reactivity system is primarily runtime-based: the tracking and triggering are all performed while the code is running directly in the browser. The pros of runtime reactivity are that it can work without a build step, and there are fewer edge cases. On the other hand, this makes it constrained by the syntax limitations of JavaScript, leading to the need of value containers like Vue refs.\n\nSome frameworks, such as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), choose to overcome such limitations by implementing reactivity during compilation. It analyzes and transforms the code in order to simulate reactivity. The compilation step allows the framework to alter the semantics of JavaScript itself - for example, implicitly injecting code that performs dependency analysis and effect triggering around access to locally defined variables. The downside is that such transforms require a build step, and altering JavaScript semantics is essentially creating a language that looks like JavaScript but compiles into something else.\n\nThe Vue team did explore this direction via an experimental feature called [Reactivity Transform](reactivity-transform), but in the end we have decided that it would not be a good fit for the project due to [the reasoning here](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369#discussioncomment-5059028).\n\n## Reactivity Debugging\n\nIt's great that Vue's reactivity system automatically tracks dependencies, but in some cases we may want to figure out exactly what is being tracked, or what is causing a component to re-render.\n\n### Component Debugging Hooks\n\nWe can debug what dependencies are used during a component's render and which dependency is triggering an update using the `renderTracked``onRenderTracked` and `renderTriggered``onRenderTriggered` lifecycle hooks. Both hooks will receive a debugger event which contains information on the dependency in question. It is recommended to place a `debugger` statement in the callbacks to interactively inspect the dependency:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { onRenderTracked, onRenderTriggered } from 'vue'\n\nonRenderTracked((event) => {\n  debugger\n})\n\nonRenderTriggered((event) => {\n  debugger\n})\n</script>\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  renderTracked(event) {\n    debugger\n  },\n  renderTriggered(event) {\n    debugger\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nComponent debug hooks only work in development mode.\n\nThe debug event objects have the following type:\n\n``` ts\ntype DebuggerEvent = {\n  effect: ReactiveEffect\n  target: object\n  type:\n    | TrackOpTypes /* 'get' | 'has' | 'iterate' */\n    | TriggerOpTypes /* 'set' | 'add' | 'delete' | 'clear' */\n  key: any\n  newValue?: any\n  oldValue?: any\n  oldTarget?: Map<any, any> | Set<any>\n}\n```\n\n### Computed Debugging\n\nWe can debug computed properties by passing `computed()` a second options object with `onTrack` and `onTrigger` callbacks:\n\n- `onTrack` will be called when a reactive property or ref is tracked as a dependency.\n- `onTrigger` will be called when the watcher callback is triggered by the mutation of a dependency.\n\nBoth callbacks will receive debugger events in the [same format](#debugger-event) as component debug hooks:\n\n``` js\nconst plusOne = computed(() => count.value + 1, {\n  onTrack(e) {\n    // triggered when count.value is tracked as a dependency\n    debugger\n  },\n  onTrigger(e) {\n    // triggered when count.value is mutated\n    debugger\n  }\n})\n\n// access plusOne, should trigger onTrack\nconsole.log(plusOne.value)\n\n// mutate count.value, should trigger onTrigger\ncount.value++\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\n`onTrack` and `onTrigger` computed options only work in development mode.\n\n### Watcher Debugging\n\nSimilar to `computed()`, watchers also support the `onTrack` and `onTrigger` options:\n\n``` js\nwatch(source, callback, {\n  onTrack(e) {\n    debugger\n  },\n  onTrigger(e) {\n    debugger\n  }\n})\n\nwatchEffect(callback, {\n  onTrack(e) {\n    debugger\n  },\n  onTrigger(e) {\n    debugger\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\n`onTrack` and `onTrigger` watcher options only work in development mode.\n\n## Integration with External State Systems\n\nVue's reactivity system works by deeply converting plain JavaScript objects into reactive proxies. The deep conversion can be unnecessary or sometimes unwanted when integrating with external state management systems (e.g. if an external solution also uses Proxies).\n\nThe general idea of integrating Vue's reactivity system with an external state management solution is to hold the external state in a [`shallowRef`](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref). A shallow ref is only reactive when its `.value` property is accessed - the inner value is left intact. When the external state changes, replace the ref value to trigger updates.\n\n### Immutable Data\n\nIf you are implementing an undo / redo feature, you likely want to take a snapshot of the application's state on every user edit. However, Vue's mutable reactivity system isn't best suited for this if the state tree is large, because serializing the entire state object on every update can be expensive in terms of both CPU and memory costs.\n\n[Immutable data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) solve this by never mutating the state objects - instead, it creates new objects that share the same, unchanged parts with old ones. There are different ways of using immutable data in JavaScript, but we recommend using [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) with Vue because it allows you to use immutable data while keeping the more ergonomic, mutable syntax.\n\nWe can integrate Immer with Vue via a simple composable:\n\n``` js\nimport produce from 'immer'\nimport { shallowRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useImmer(baseState) {\n  const state = shallowRef(baseState)\n  const update = (updater) => {\n    state.value = produce(state.value, updater)\n  }\n\n  return [state, update]\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n### State Machines\n\n[State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) is a model for describing all the possible states an application can be in, and all the possible ways it can transition from one state to another. While it may be overkill for simple components, it can help make complex state flows more robust and manageable.\n\nOne of the most popular state machine implementations in JavaScript is [XState](https://xstate.js.org/). Here's a composable that integrates with it:\n\n``` js\nimport { createMachine, interpret } from 'xstate'\nimport { shallowRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useMachine(options) {\n  const machine = createMachine(options)\n  const state = shallowRef(machine.initialState)\n  const service = interpret(machine)\n    .onTransition((newState) => (state.value = newState))\n    .start()\n  const send = (event) => service.send(event)\n\n  return [state, send]\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n### RxJS\n\n[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) is a library for working with asynchronous event streams. The [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) library provides the [`@vueuse/rxjs`](https://vueuse.org/rxjs/readme.html) add-on for connecting RxJS streams with Vue's reactivity system.\n\n## Connection to Signals\n\nQuite a few other frameworks have introduced reactivity primitives similar to refs from Vue's Composition API, under the term \"signals\":\n\n- [Solid Signals](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#createsignal)\n- [Angular Signals](https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49090)\n- [Preact Signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/)\n- [Qwik Signals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/components/state/#usesignal)\n\nFundamentally, signals are the same kind of reactivity primitive as Vue refs. It's a value container that provides dependency tracking on access, and side-effect triggering on mutation. This reactivity-primitive-based paradigm isn't a particularly new concept in the frontend world: it dates back to implementations like [Knockout observables](https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html) and [Meteor Tracker](https://docs.meteor.com/api/tracker.html) from more than a decade ago. Vue Options API and the React state management library [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) are also based on the same principles, but hide the primitives behind object properties.\n\nAlthough not a necessary trait for something to qualify as signals, today the concept is often discussed alongside the rendering model where updates are performed through fine-grained subscriptions. Due to the use of Virtual DOM, Vue currently [relies on compilers to achieve similar optimizations](rendering-mechanism#compiler-informed-virtual-dom). However, we are also exploring a new Solid-inspired compilation strategy (Vapor Mode) that does not rely on Virtual DOM and takes more advantage of Vue's built-in reactivity system.\n\n### API Design Trade-Offs\n\nThe design of Preact and Qwik's signals are very similar to Vue's [shallowRef](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref): all three provide a mutable interface via the `.value` property. We will focus the discussion on Solid and Angular signals.\n\n#### Solid Signals\n\nSolid's `createSignal()` API design emphasizes read / write segregation. Signals are exposed as a read-only getter and a separate setter:\n\n``` js\nconst [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)\n\ncount() // access the value\nsetCount(1) // update the value\n```\n\nNotice how the `count` signal can be passed down without the setter. This ensures that the state can never be mutated unless the setter is also explicitly exposed. Whether this safety guarantee justifies the more verbose syntax could be subject to the requirement of the project and personal taste - but in case you prefer this API style, you can easily replicate it in Vue:\n\n``` js\nimport { shallowRef, triggerRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport function createSignal(value, options) {\n  const r = shallowRef(value)\n  const get = () => r.value\n  const set = (v) => {\n    r.value = typeof v === 'function' ? v(r.value) : v\n    if (options?.equals === false) triggerRef(r)\n  }\n  return [get, set]\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpdUk1TgzAQ/Ss7uQAjgr12oNXxH+ix9IAYaDQkMV/qMPx3N6G0Uy9Msu/tvn2PTORJqcI7SrakMp1myoKh1qldI9iopLYwQadpa+krG0TLYYZeyxGSojSSs/d7E8vFh0ka0YhOCmPh0EknbB4mPYfTEeqbIelD1oiqXPRQCS+WjoojAW8A1Wmzm1A39KYZzHNVYiUib85aKeCx46z7rBuySqQe6h14uINN1pDIBWACVUcqbGwtl17EqvIiR3LyzwcmcXFuTi3n8vuF9jlYzYaBajxfMsDcomv6E/m9E51luN2NV99yR3OQKkAmgykss+SkMZerxMLEZFZ4oBYJGAA600VEryAaD6CPaJwJKwnr9ldR2WMedV1Dsi6WwB58emZlsAV/zqmH9LzfvqBfruUmNvZ4QN7VearjenP4aHwmWsABt4x/+tiImcx/z27Jqw==)\n\n#### Angular Signals\n\nAngular is undergoing some fundamental changes by foregoing dirty-checking and introducing its own implementation of a reactivity primitive. The Angular Signal API looks like this:\n\n``` js\nconst count = signal(0)\n\ncount() // access the value\ncount.set(1) // set new value\ncount.update((v) => v + 1) // update based on previous value\n\n// mutate deep objects with same identity\nconst state = signal({ count: 0 })\nstate.mutate((o) => {\n  o.count++\n})\n```\n\nAgain, we can easily replicate the API in Vue:\n\n``` js\nimport { shallowRef, triggerRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport function signal(initialValue) {\n  const r = shallowRef(initialValue)\n  const s = () => r.value\n  s.set = (value) => {\n    r.value = value\n  }\n  s.update = (updater) => {\n    r.value = updater(r.value)\n  }\n  s.mutate = (mutator) => {\n    mutator(r.value)\n    triggerRef(r)\n  }\n  return s\n}\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\nCompared to Vue refs, Solid and Angular's getter-based API style provide some interesting trade-offs when used in Vue components:\n\n- `()` is slightly less verbose than `.value`, but updating the value is more verbose.\n- There is no ref-unwrapping: accessing values always require `()`. This makes value access consistent everywhere. This also means you can pass raw signals down as component props.\n\nWhether these API styles suit you is to some extent subjective. Our goal here is to demonstrate the underlying similarity and trade-offs between these different API designs. We also want to show that Vue is flexible: you are not really locked into the existing APIs. Should it be necessary, you can create your own reactivity primitive API to suit more specific needs.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth)"

  summary: How does Vue take a template and turn it into actual DOM nodes? How does Vue update those DOM nodes efficiently? We will attempt to shed some light on these questions here by diving into Vue's internal rendering mechanism
  description: "# Rendering Mechanism\n\nHow does Vue take a template and turn it into actual DOM nodes? How does Vue update those DOM nodes efficiently? We will attempt to shed some light on these questions here by diving into Vue's internal rendering mechanism.\n\n## Virtual DOM\n\nYou have probably heard about the term \"virtual DOM\", which Vue's rendering system is based upon.\n\nThe virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM. The concept was pioneered by [React](https://reactjs.org/), and has been adopted in many other frameworks with different implementations, including Vue.\n\nVirtual DOM is more of a pattern than a specific technology, so there is no one canonical implementation. We can illustrate the idea using a simple example:\n\n``` js\nconst vnode = {\n  type: 'div',\n  props: {\n    id: 'hello'\n  },\n  children: [\n    /* more vnodes */\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere, `vnode` is a plain JavaScript object (a \"virtual node\") representing a `<div>` element. It contains all the information that we need to create the actual element. It also contains more children vnodes, which makes it the root of a virtual DOM tree.\n\nA runtime renderer can walk a virtual DOM tree and construct a real DOM tree from it. This process is called **mount**.\n\nIf we have two copies of virtual DOM trees, the renderer can also walk and compare the two trees, figuring out the differences, and apply those changes to the actual DOM. This process is called **patch**, also known as \"diffing\" or \"reconciliation\".\n\nThe main benefit of virtual DOM is that it gives the developer the ability to programmatically create, inspect and compose desired UI structures in a declarative way, while leaving the direct DOM manipulation to the renderer.\n\n## Render Pipeline\n\nAt the high level, this is what happens when a Vue component is mounted:\n\n1.  **Compile**: Vue templates are compiled into **render functions**: functions that return virtual DOM trees. This step can be done either ahead-of-time via a build step, or on-the-fly by using the runtime compiler.\n\n2.  **Mount**: The runtime renderer invokes the render functions, walks the returned virtual DOM tree, and creates actual DOM nodes based on it. This step is performed as a [reactive effect](reactivity-in-depth), so it keeps track of all reactive dependencies that were used.\n\n3.  **Patch**: When a dependency used during mount changes, the effect re-runs. This time, a new, updated Virtual DOM tree is created. The runtime renderer walks the new tree, compares it with the old one, and applies necessary updates to the actual DOM.\n\n## Templates vs. Render Functions\n\nVue templates are compiled into virtual DOM render functions. Vue also provides APIs that allow us to skip the template compilation step and directly author render functions. Render functions are more flexible than templates when dealing with highly dynamic logic, because you can work with vnodes using the full power of JavaScript.\n\nSo why does Vue recommend templates by default? There are a number of reasons:\n\n1.  Templates are closer to actual HTML. This makes it easier to reuse existing HTML snippets, apply accessibility best practices, style with CSS, and for designers to understand and modify.\n\n2.  Templates are easier to statically analyze due to their more deterministic syntax. This allows Vue's template compiler to apply many compile-time optimizations to improve the performance of the virtual DOM (which we will discuss below).\n\nIn practice, templates are sufficient for most use cases in applications. Render functions are typically only used in reusable components that need to deal with highly dynamic rendering logic. Render function usage is discussed in more detail in [Render Functions & JSX](render-function).\n\n## Compiler-Informed Virtual DOM\n\nThe virtual DOM implementation in React and most other virtual-DOM implementations are purely runtime: the reconciliation algorithm cannot make any assumptions about the incoming virtual DOM tree, so it has to fully traverse the tree and diff the props of every vnode in order to ensure correctness. In addition, even if a part of the tree never changes, new vnodes are always created for them on each re-render, resulting in unnecessary memory pressure. This is one of the most criticized aspect of virtual DOM: the somewhat brute-force reconciliation process sacrifices efficiency in return for declarativeness and correctness.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. In Vue, the framework controls both the compiler and the runtime. This allows us to implement many compile-time optimizations that only a tightly-coupled renderer can take advantage of. The compiler can statically analyze the template and leave hints in the generated code so that the runtime can take shortcuts whenever possible. At the same time, we still preserve the capability for the user to drop down to the render function layer for more direct control in edge cases. We call this hybrid approach **Compiler-Informed Virtual DOM**.\n\nBelow, we will discuss a few major optimizations done by the Vue template compiler to improve the virtual DOM's runtime performance.\n\n### Static Hoisting\n\nQuite often there will be parts in a template that do not contain any dynamic bindings:\n\n``` template\n<div>\n  <div>foo</div> <!-- hoisted -->\n  <div>bar</div> <!-- hoisted -->\n  <div>{{ dynamic }}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n[Inspect in Template Explorer](https://template-explorer.vuejs.org/#eyJzcmMiOiI8ZGl2PlxuICA8ZGl2PmZvbzwvZGl2PiA8IS0tIGhvaXN0ZWQgLS0+XG4gIDxkaXY+YmFyPC9kaXY+IDwhLS0gaG9pc3RlZCAtLT5cbiAgPGRpdj57eyBkeW5hbWljIH19PC9kaXY+XG48L2Rpdj5cbiIsIm9wdGlvbnMiOnsiaG9pc3RTdGF0aWMiOnRydWV9fQ==)\n\nThe `foo` and `bar` divs are static - re-creating vnodes and diffing them on each re-render is unnecessary. The Vue compiler automatically hoists their vnode creation calls out of the render function, and reuses the same vnodes on every render. The renderer is also able to completely skip diffing them when it notices the old vnode and the new vnode are the same one.\n\nIn addition, when there are enough consecutive static elements, they will be condensed into a single \"static vnode\" that contains the plain HTML string for all these nodes ([Example](https://template-explorer.vuejs.org/#eyJzcmMiOiI8ZGl2PlxuICA8ZGl2IGNsYXNzPVwiZm9vXCI+Zm9vPC9kaXY+XG4gIDxkaXYgY2xhc3M9XCJmb29cIj5mb288L2Rpdj5cbiAgPGRpdiBjbGFzcz1cImZvb1wiPmZvbzwvZGl2PlxuICA8ZGl2IGNsYXNzPVwiZm9vXCI+Zm9vPC9kaXY+XG4gIDxkaXYgY2xhc3M9XCJmb29cIj5mb288L2Rpdj5cbiAgPGRpdj57eyBkeW5hbWljIH19PC9kaXY+XG48L2Rpdj4iLCJzc3IiOmZhbHNlLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7ImhvaXN0U3RhdGljIjp0cnVlfX0=)). These static vnodes are mounted by directly setting `innerHTML`. They also cache their corresponding DOM nodes on initial mount - if the same piece of content is reused elsewhere in the app, new DOM nodes are created using native `cloneNode()`, which is extremely efficient.\n\n### Patch Flags\n\nFor a single element with dynamic bindings, we can also infer a lot of information from it at compile time:\n\n``` template\n<!-- class binding only -->\n<div :class=\"{ active }\"></div>\n\n<!-- id and value bindings only -->\n<input :id=\"id\" :value=\"value\">\n\n<!-- text children only -->\n<div>{{ dynamic }}</div>\n```\n\n[Inspect in Template Explorer](https://template-explorer.vuejs.org/#eyJzcmMiOiI8ZGl2IDpjbGFzcz1cInsgYWN0aXZlIH1cIj48L2Rpdj5cblxuPGlucHV0IDppZD1cImlkXCIgOnZhbHVlPVwidmFsdWVcIj5cblxuPGRpdj57eyBkeW5hbWljIH19PC9kaXY+Iiwib3B0aW9ucyI6e319)\n\nWhen generating the render function code for these elements, Vue encodes the type of update each of them needs directly in the vnode creation call:\n\n``` js\ncreateElementVNode(\"div\", {\n  class: _normalizeClass({ active: _ctx.active })\n}, null, 2 /* CLASS */)\n```\n\nThe last argument, `2`, is a [patch flag](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/shared/src/patchFlags.ts). An element can have multiple patch flags, which will be merged into a single number. The runtime renderer can then check against the flags using [bitwise operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) to determine whether it needs to do certain work:\n\n``` js\nif (vnode.patchFlag & PatchFlags.CLASS /* 2 */) {\n  // update the element's class\n}\n```\n\nBitwise checks are extremely fast. With the patch flags, Vue is able to do the least amount of work necessary when updating elements with dynamic bindings.\n\nVue also encodes the type of children a vnode has. For example, a template that has multiple root nodes is represented as a fragment. In most cases, we know for sure that the order of these root nodes will never change, so this information can also be provided to the runtime as a patch flag:\n\n``` js\nexport function render() {\n  return (_openBlock(), _createElementBlock(_Fragment, null, [\n    /* children */\n  ], 64 /* STABLE_FRAGMENT */))\n}\n```\n\nThe runtime can thus completely skip child-order reconciliation for the root fragment.\n\n### Tree Flattening\n\nTaking another look at the generated code from the previous example, you'll notice the root of the returned virtual DOM tree is created using a special `createElementBlock()` call:\n\n``` js\nexport function render() {\n  return (_openBlock(), _createElementBlock(_Fragment, null, [\n    /* children */\n  ], 64 /* STABLE_FRAGMENT */))\n}\n```\n\nConceptually, a \"block\" is a part of the template that has stable inner structure. In this case, the entire template has a single block because it does not contain any structural directives like `v-if` and `v-for`.\n\nEach block tracks any descendant nodes (not just direct children) that have patch flags. For example:\n\n``` template\n<div> <!-- root block -->\n  <div>...</div>         <!-- not tracked -->\n  <div :id=\"id\"></div>   <!-- tracked -->\n  <div>                  <!-- not tracked -->\n    <div>{{ bar }}</div> <!-- tracked -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe result is a flattened array that contains only the dynamic descendant nodes:\n\n``` \ndiv (block root)\n- div with :id binding\n- div with {{ bar }} binding\n```\n\nWhen this component needs to re-render, it only needs to traverse the flattened tree instead of the full tree. This is called **Tree Flattening**, and it greatly reduces the number of nodes that need to be traversed during virtual DOM reconciliation. Any static parts of the template are effectively skipped.\n\n`v-if` and `v-for` directives will create new block nodes:\n\n``` template\n<div> <!-- root block -->\n  <div>\n    <div v-if> <!-- if block -->\n      ...\n    <div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nA child block is tracked inside the parent block's array of dynamic descendants. This retains a stable structure for the parent block.\n\n### Impact on SSR Hydration\n\nBoth patch flags and tree flattening also greatly improve Vue's [SSR Hydration](../scaling-up/ssr#client-hydration) performance:\n\n- Single element hydration can take fast paths based on the corresponding vnode's patch flag.\n\n- Only block nodes and their dynamic descendants need to be traversed during hydration, effectively achieving partial hydration at the template level.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/rendering-mechanism](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/rendering-mechanism)"

  summary: Vue recommends using templates to build applications in the vast majority of cases
  description: "# Render Functions & JSX\n\nVue recommends using templates to build applications in the vast majority of cases. However, there are situations where we need the full programmatic power of JavaScript. That's where we can use the **render function**.\n\n> If you are new to the concept of virtual DOM and render functions, make sure to read the [Rendering Mechanism](rendering-mechanism) chapter first.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Creating Vnodes\n\nVue provides an `h()` function for creating vnodes:\n\n``` js\nimport { h } from 'vue'\n\nconst vnode = h(\n  'div', // type\n  { id: 'foo', class: 'bar' }, // props\n  [\n    /* children */\n  ]\n)\n```\n\n`h()` is short for **hyperscript** - which means \"JavaScript that produces HTML (hypertext markup language)\". This name is inherited from conventions shared by many virtual DOM implementations. A more descriptive name could be `createVnode()`, but a shorter name helps when you have to call this function many times in a render function.\n\nThe `h()` function is designed to be very flexible:\n\n``` js\n// all arguments except the type are optional\nh('div')\nh('div', { id: 'foo' })\n\n// both attributes and properties can be used in props\n// Vue automatically picks the right way to assign it\nh('div', { class: 'bar', innerHTML: 'hello' })\n\n// props modifiers such as `.prop` and `.attr` can be added\n// with `.` and `^` prefixes respectively\nh('div', { '.name': 'some-name', '^width': '100' })\n\n// class and style have the same object / array\n// value support that they have in templates\nh('div', { class: [foo, { bar }], style: { color: 'red' } })\n\n// event listeners should be passed as onXxx\nh('div', { onClick: () => {} })\n\n// children can be a string\nh('div', { id: 'foo' }, 'hello')\n\n// props can be omitted when there are no props\nh('div', 'hello')\nh('div', [h('span', 'hello')])\n\n// children array can contain mixed vnodes and strings\nh('div', ['hello', h('span', 'hello')])\n```\n\nThe resulting vnode has the following shape:\n\n``` js\nconst vnode = h('div', { id: 'foo' }, [])\n\nvnode.type // 'div'\nvnode.props // { id: 'foo' }\nvnode.children // []\nvnode.key // null\n```\n\n**Note**\n\nThe full `VNode` interface contains many other internal properties, but it is strongly recommended to avoid relying on any properties other than the ones listed here. This avoids unintended breakage in case the internal properties are changed.\n\n### Declaring Render Functions\n\nWhen using templates with Composition API, the return value of the `setup()` hook is used to expose data to the template. When using render functions, however, we can directly return the render function instead:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref, h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    /* ... */\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    const count = ref(1)\n\n    // return the render function\n    return () => h('div', props.msg + count.value)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe render function is declared inside `setup()` so it naturally has access to the props and any reactive state declared in the same scope.\n\nIn addition to returning a single vnode, you can also return strings or arrays:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    return () => 'hello world!'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    // use an array to return multiple root nodes\n    return () => [\n      h('div'),\n      h('div'),\n      h('div')\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nMake sure to return a function instead of directly returning values! The `setup()` function is called only once per component, while the returned render function will be called multiple times.\n\nWe can declare render functions using the `render` option:\n\n``` js\nimport { h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      msg: 'hello'\n    }\n  },\n  render() {\n    return h('div', this.msg)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `render()` function has access to the component instance via `this`.\n\nIn addition to returning a single vnode, you can also return strings or arrays:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  render() {\n    return 'hello world!'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  render() {\n    // use an array to return multiple root nodes\n    return [\n      h('div'),\n      h('div'),\n      h('div')\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf a render function component doesn't need any instance state, they can also be declared directly as a function for brevity:\n\n``` js\nfunction Hello() {\n  return 'hello world!'\n}\n```\n\nThat's right, this is a valid Vue component! See [Functional Components](#functional-components) for more details on this syntax.\n\n### Vnodes Must Be Unique\n\nAll vnodes in the component tree must be unique. That means the following render function is invalid:\n\n``` js\nfunction render() {\n  const p = h('p', 'hi')\n  return h('div', [\n    // Yikes - duplicate vnodes!\n    p,\n    p\n  ])\n}\n```\n\nIf you really want to duplicate the same element/component many times, you can do so with a factory function. For example, the following render function is a perfectly valid way of rendering 20 identical paragraphs:\n\n``` js\nfunction render() {\n  return h(\n    'div',\n    Array.from({ length: 20 }).map(() => {\n      return h('p', 'hi')\n    })\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## JSX / TSX\n\n[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is an XML-like extension to JavaScript that allows us to write code like this:\n\n``` jsx\nconst vnode = <div>hello</div>\n```\n\nInside JSX expressions, use curly braces to embed dynamic values:\n\n``` jsx\nconst vnode = <div id={dynamicId}>hello, {userName}</div>\n```\n\n`create-vue` and Vue CLI both have options for scaffolding projects with pre-configured JSX support. If you are configuring JSX manually, please refer to the documentation of [`@vue/babel-plugin-jsx`](https://github.com/vuejs/jsx-next) for details.\n\nAlthough first introduced by React, JSX actually has no defined runtime semantics and can be compiled into various different outputs. If you have worked with JSX before, do note that **Vue JSX transform is different from React's JSX transform**, so you can't use React's JSX transform in Vue applications. Some notable differences from React JSX include:\n\n- You can use HTML attributes such as `class` and `for` as props - no need to use `className` or `htmlFor`.\n- Passing children to components (i.e. slots) [works differently](#passing-slots).\n\nVue's type definition also provides type inference for TSX usage. When using TSX, make sure to specify `\"jsx\": \"preserve\"` in `tsconfig.json` so that TypeScript leaves the JSX syntax intact for Vue JSX transform to process.\n\n### JSX Type Inference\n\nSimilar to the transform, Vue's JSX also needs different type definitions.\n\nStarting in Vue 3.4, Vue no longer implicitly registers the global `JSX` namespace. To instruct TypeScript to use Vue's JSX type definitions, make sure to include the following in your `tsconfig.json`:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"jsxImportSource\": \"vue\"\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also opt-in per file by adding a `/* @jsxImportSource vue */` comment at the top of the file.\n\nIf there is code that depends on the presence of the global `JSX` namespace, you can retain the exact pre-3.4 global behavior by explicitly importing or referencing `vue/jsx` in your project, which registers the global `JSX` namespace.\n\n## Render Function Recipes\n\nBelow we will provide some common recipes for implementing template features as their equivalent render functions / JSX.\n\n### `v-if`\n\nTemplate:\n\n``` template\n<div>\n  <div v-if=\"ok\">yes</div>\n  <span v-else>no</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nEquivalent render function / JSX:\n\n``` js\nh('div', [ok.value ? h('div', 'yes') : h('span', 'no')])\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<div>{ok.value ? <div>yes</div> : <span>no</span>}</div>\n```\n\n``` js\nh('div', [this.ok ? h('div', 'yes') : h('span', 'no')])\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<div>{this.ok ? <div>yes</div> : <span>no</span>}</div>\n```\n\n### `v-for`\n\nTemplate:\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li v-for=\"{ id, text } in items\" :key=\"id\">\n    {{ text }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nEquivalent render function / JSX:\n\n``` js\nh(\n  'ul',\n  // assuming `items` is a ref with array value\n  items.value.map(({ id, text }) => {\n    return h('li', { key: id }, text)\n  })\n)\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<ul>\n  {items.value.map(({ id, text }) => {\n    return <li key={id}>{text}</li>\n  })}\n</ul>\n```\n\n``` js\nh(\n  'ul',\n  this.items.map(({ id, text }) => {\n    return h('li', { key: id }, text)\n  })\n)\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<ul>\n  {this.items.map(({ id, text }) => {\n    return <li key={id}>{text}</li>\n  })}\n</ul>\n```\n\n### `v-on`\n\nProps with names that start with `on` followed by an uppercase letter are treated as event listeners. For example, `onClick` is the equivalent of `@click` in templates.\n\n``` js\nh(\n  'button',\n  {\n    onClick(event) {\n      /* ... */\n    }\n  },\n  'click me'\n)\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<button\n  onClick={(event) => {\n    /* ... */\n  }}\n>\n  click me\n</button>\n```\n\n#### Event Modifiers\n\nFor the `.passive`, `.capture`, and `.once` event modifiers, they can be concatenated after the event name using camelCase.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\nh('input', {\n  onClickCapture() {\n    /* listener in capture mode */\n  },\n  onKeyupOnce() {\n    /* triggers only once */\n  },\n  onMouseoverOnceCapture() {\n    /* once + capture */\n  }\n})\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<input\n  onClickCapture={() => {}}\n  onKeyupOnce={() => {}}\n  onMouseoverOnceCapture={() => {}}\n/>\n```\n\nFor other event and key modifiers, the [`withModifiers`](../../api/render-function#withmodifiers) helper can be used:\n\n``` js\nimport { withModifiers } from 'vue'\n\nh('div', {\n  onClick: withModifiers(() => {}, ['self'])\n})\n```\n\n``` jsx\n<div onClick={withModifiers(() => {}, ['self'])} />\n```\n\n### Components\n\nTo create a vnode for a component, the first argument passed to `h()` should be the component definition. This means when using render functions, it is unnecessary to register components - you can just use the imported components directly:\n\n``` js\nimport Foo from './Foo.vue'\nimport Bar from './Bar.jsx'\n\nfunction render() {\n  return h('div', [h(Foo), h(Bar)])\n}\n```\n\n``` jsx\nfunction render() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Foo />\n      <Bar />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAs we can see, `h` can work with components imported from any file format as long as it's a valid Vue component.\n\nDynamic components are straightforward with render functions:\n\n``` js\nimport Foo from './Foo.vue'\nimport Bar from './Bar.jsx'\n\nfunction render() {\n  return ok.value ? h(Foo) : h(Bar)\n}\n```\n\n``` jsx\nfunction render() {\n  return ok.value ? <Foo /> : <Bar />\n}\n```\n\nIf a component is registered by name and cannot be imported directly (for example, globally registered by a library), it can be programmatically resolved by using the [`resolveComponent()`](../../api/render-function#resolvecomponent) helper.\n\n### Rendering Slots\n\nIn render functions, slots can be accessed from the `setup()` context. Each slot on the `slots` object is a **function that returns an array of vnodes**:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['message'],\n  setup(props, { slots }) {\n    return () => [\n      // default slot:\n      // <div><slot /></div>\n      h('div', slots.default()),\n\n      // named slot:\n      // <div><slot name=\"footer\" :text=\"message\" /></div>\n      h(\n        'div',\n        slots.footer({\n          text: props.message\n        })\n      )\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJSX equivalent:\n\n``` jsx\n// default\n<div>{slots.default()}</div>\n\n// named\n<div>{slots.footer({ text: props.message })}</div>\n```\n\nIn render functions, slots can be accessed from [`this.$slots`](../../api/component-instance#slots):\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['message'],\n  render() {\n    return [\n      // <div><slot /></div>\n      h('div', this.$slots.default()),\n\n      // <div><slot name=\"footer\" :text=\"message\" /></div>\n      h(\n        'div',\n        this.$slots.footer({\n          text: this.message\n        })\n      )\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJSX equivalent:\n\n``` jsx\n// <div><slot /></div>\n<div>{this.$slots.default()}</div>\n\n// <div><slot name=\"footer\" :text=\"message\" /></div>\n<div>{this.$slots.footer({ text: this.message })}</div>\n```\n\n### Passing Slots\n\nPassing children to components works a bit differently from passing children to elements. Instead of an array, we need to pass either a slot function, or an object of slot functions. Slot functions can return anything a normal render function can return - which will always be normalized to arrays of vnodes when accessed in the child component.\n\n``` js\n// single default slot\nh(MyComponent, () => 'hello')\n\n// named slots\n// notice the `null` is required to avoid\n// the slots object being treated as props\nh(MyComponent, null, {\n  default: () => 'default slot',\n  foo: () => h('div', 'foo'),\n  bar: () => [h('span', 'one'), h('span', 'two')]\n})\n```\n\nJSX equivalent:\n\n``` jsx\n// default\n<MyComponent>{() => 'hello'}</MyComponent>\n\n// named\n<MyComponent>{{\n  default: () => 'default slot',\n  foo: () => <div>foo</div>,\n  bar: () => [<span>one</span>, <span>two</span>]\n}}</MyComponent>\n```\n\nPassing slots as functions allows them to be invoked lazily by the child component. This leads to the slot's dependencies being tracked by the child instead of the parent, which results in more accurate and efficient updates.\n\n### Built-in Components\n\n[Built-in components](../../api/built-in-components) such as `<KeepAlive>`, `<Transition>`, `<TransitionGroup>`, `<Teleport>` and `<Suspense>` must be imported for use in render functions:\n\n``` js\nimport { h, KeepAlive, Teleport, Transition, TransitionGroup } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup () {\n    return () => h(Transition, { mode: 'out-in' }, /* ... */)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { h, KeepAlive, Teleport, Transition, TransitionGroup } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  render () {\n    return h(Transition, { mode: 'out-in' }, /* ... */)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `v-model`\n\nThe `v-model` directive is expanded to `modelValue` and `onUpdate:modelValue` props during template compilation—we will have to provide these props ourselves:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['modelValue'],\n  emits: ['update:modelValue'],\n  setup(props, { emit }) {\n    return () =>\n      h(SomeComponent, {\n        modelValue: props.modelValue,\n        'onUpdate:modelValue': (value) => emit('update:modelValue', value)\n      })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: ['modelValue'],\n  emits: ['update:modelValue'],\n  render() {\n    return h(SomeComponent, {\n      modelValue: this.modelValue,\n      'onUpdate:modelValue': (value) => this.$emit('update:modelValue', value)\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Directives\n\nCustom directives can be applied to a vnode using [`withDirectives`](../../api/render-function#withdirectives):\n\n``` js\nimport { h, withDirectives } from 'vue'\n\n// a custom directive\nconst pin = {\n  mounted() { /* ... */ },\n  updated() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// <div v-pin:top.animate=\"200\"></div>\nconst vnode = withDirectives(h('div'), [\n  [pin, 200, 'top', { animate: true }]\n])\n```\n\nIf the directive is registered by name and cannot be imported directly, it can be resolved using the [`resolveDirective`](../../api/render-function#resolvedirective) helper.\n\n### Template Refs\n\nWith the Composition API, template refs are created by passing the `ref()` itself as a prop to the vnode:\n\n``` js\nimport { h, ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const divEl = ref()\n\n    // <div ref=\"divEl\">\n    return () => h('div', { ref: divEl })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith the Options API, template refs are created by passing the ref name as a string in the vnode props:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  render() {\n    // <div ref=\"divEl\">\n    return h('div', { ref: 'divEl' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Functional Components\n\nFunctional components are an alternative form of component that don't have any state of their own. They act like pure functions: props in, vnodes out. They are rendered without creating a component instance (i.e. no `this`), and without the usual component lifecycle hooks.\n\nTo create a functional component we use a plain function, rather than an options object. The function is effectively the `render` function for the component.\n\nThe signature of a functional component is the same as the `setup()` hook:\n\n``` js\nfunction MyComponent(props, { slots, emit, attrs }) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nAs there is no `this` reference for a functional component, Vue will pass in the `props` as the first argument:\n\n``` js\nfunction MyComponent(props, context) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe second argument, `context`, contains three properties: `attrs`, `emit`, and `slots`. These are equivalent to the instance properties [`$attrs`](../../api/component-instance#attrs), [`$emit`](../../api/component-instance#emit), and [`$slots`](../../api/component-instance#slots) respectively.\n\nMost of the usual configuration options for components are not available for functional components. However, it is possible to define [`props`](../../api/options-state#props) and [`emits`](../../api/options-state#emits) by adding them as properties:\n\n``` js\nMyComponent.props = ['value']\nMyComponent.emits = ['click']\n```\n\nIf the `props` option is not specified, then the `props` object passed to the function will contain all attributes, the same as `attrs`. The prop names will not be normalized to camelCase unless the `props` option is specified.\n\nFor functional components with explicit `props`, [attribute fallthrough](../components/attrs) works much the same as with normal components. However, for functional components that don't explicitly specify their `props`, only the `class`, `style`, and `onXxx` event listeners will be inherited from the `attrs` by default. In either case, `inheritAttrs` can be set to `false` to disable attribute inheritance:\n\n``` js\nMyComponent.inheritAttrs = false\n```\n\nFunctional components can be registered and consumed just like normal components. If you pass a function as the first argument to `h()`, it will be treated as a functional component.\n\n### Typing Functional Components\n\nFunctional Components can be typed based on whether they are named or anonymous. Volar also supports type checking properly typed functional components when consuming them in SFC templates.\n\n**Named Functional Component**\n\n``` tsx\nimport type { SetupContext } from 'vue'\ntype FComponentProps = {\n  message: string\n}\n\ntype Events = {\n  sendMessage(message: string): void\n}\n\nfunction FComponent(\n  props: FComponentProps,\n  context: SetupContext<Events>\n) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => context.emit('sendMessage', props.message)}>\n        {props.message} {' '}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\nFComponent.props = {\n  message: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  }\n}\n\nFComponent.emits = {\n  sendMessage: (value: unknown) => typeof value === 'string'\n}\n```\n\n**Anonymous Functional Component**\n\n``` tsx\nimport type { FunctionalComponent } from 'vue'\n\ntype FComponentProps = {\n  message: string\n}\n\ntype Events = {\n  sendMessage(message: string): void\n}\n\nconst FComponent: FunctionalComponent<FComponentProps, Events> = (\n  props,\n  context\n) => {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => context.emit('sendMessage', props.message)}>\n        {props.message} {' '}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\nFComponent.props = {\n  message: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  }\n}\n\nFComponent.emits = {\n  sendMessage: (value) => typeof value === 'string'\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function)"

  summary: Web Components is an umbrella term for a set of web native APIs that allows developers to create reusable custom elements
  description: "# Vue and Web Components\n\n[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) is an umbrella term for a set of web native APIs that allows developers to create reusable custom elements.\n\nWe consider Vue and Web Components to be primarily complementary technologies. Vue has excellent support for both consuming and creating custom elements. Whether you are integrating custom elements into an existing Vue application, or using Vue to build and distribute custom elements, you are in good company.\n\n## Using Custom Elements in Vue\n\nVue [scores a perfect 100% in the Custom Elements Everywhere tests](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/libraries/vue/results/results.html). Consuming custom elements inside a Vue application largely works the same as using native HTML elements, with a few things to keep in mind:\n\n### Skipping Component Resolution\n\nBy default, Vue will attempt to resolve a non-native HTML tag as a registered Vue component before falling back to rendering it as a custom element. This will cause Vue to emit a \"failed to resolve component\" warning during development. To let Vue know that certain elements should be treated as custom elements and skip component resolution, we can specify the [`compilerOptions.isCustomElement` option](../../api/application#app-config-compileroptions).\n\nIf you are using Vue with a build setup, the option should be passed via build configs since it is a compile-time option.\n\n#### Example In-Browser Config\n\n``` js\n// Only works if using in-browser compilation.\n// If using build tools, see config examples below.\napp.config.compilerOptions.isCustomElement = (tag) => tag.includes('-')\n```\n\n#### Example Vite Config\n\n``` js\n// vite.config.js\nimport vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'\n\nexport default {\n  plugins: [\n    vue({\n      template: {\n        compilerOptions: {\n          // treat all tags with a dash as custom elements\n          isCustomElement: (tag) => tag.includes('-')\n        }\n      }\n    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Example Vue CLI Config\n\n``` js\n// vue.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  chainWebpack: config => {\n    config.module\n      .rule('vue')\n      .use('vue-loader')\n      .tap(options => ({\n        ...options,\n        compilerOptions: {\n          // treat any tag that starts with ion- as custom elements\n          isCustomElement: tag => tag.startsWith('ion-')\n        }\n      }))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Passing DOM Properties\n\nSince DOM attributes can only be strings, we need to pass complex data to custom elements as DOM properties. When setting props on a custom element, Vue 3 automatically checks DOM-property presence using the `in` operator and will prefer setting the value as a DOM property if the key is present. This means that, in most cases, you won't need to think about this if the custom element follows the [recommended best practices](https://web.dev/custom-elements-best-practices/).\n\nHowever, there could be rare cases where the data must be passed as a DOM property, but the custom element does not properly define/reflect the property (causing the `in` check to fail). In this case, you can force a `v-bind` binding to be set as a DOM property using the `.prop` modifier:\n\n``` template\n<my-element :user.prop=\"{ name: 'jack' }\"></my-element>\n\n<!-- shorthand equivalent -->\n<my-element .user=\"{ name: 'jack' }\"></my-element>\n```\n\n## Building Custom Elements with Vue\n\nThe primary benefit of custom elements is that they can be used with any framework, or even without a framework. This makes them ideal for distributing components where the end consumer may not be using the same frontend stack, or when you want to insulate the end application from the implementation details of the components it uses.\n\n### defineCustomElement\n\nVue supports creating custom elements using exactly the same Vue component APIs via the [`defineCustomElement`](../../api/general#definecustomelement) method. The method accepts the same argument as [`defineComponent`](../../api/general#definecomponent), but instead returns a custom element constructor that extends `HTMLElement`:\n\n``` template\n<my-vue-element></my-vue-element>\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { defineCustomElement } from 'vue'\n\nconst MyVueElement = defineCustomElement({\n  // normal Vue component options here\n  props: {},\n  emits: {},\n  template: `...`,\n\n  // defineCustomElement only: CSS to be injected into shadow root\n  styles: [`/* inlined css */`]\n})\n\n// Register the custom element.\n// After registration, all `<my-vue-element>` tags\n// on the page will be upgraded.\ncustomElements.define('my-vue-element', MyVueElement)\n\n// You can also programmatically instantiate the element:\n// (can only be done after registration)\ndocument.body.appendChild(\n  new MyVueElement({\n    // initial props (optional)\n  })\n)\n```\n\n#### Lifecycle\n\n- A Vue custom element will mount an internal Vue component instance inside its shadow root when the element's [`connectedCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements#using_the_lifecycle_callbacks) is called for the first time.\n\n- When the element's `disconnectedCallback` is invoked, Vue will check whether the element is detached from the document after a microtask tick.\n\n  - If the element is still in the document, it's a move and the component instance will be preserved;\n\n  - If the element is detached from the document, it's a removal and the component instance will be unmounted.\n\n#### Props\n\n- All props declared using the `props` option will be defined on the custom element as properties. Vue will automatically handle the reflection between attributes / properties where appropriate.\n\n  - Attributes are always reflected to corresponding properties.\n\n  - Properties with primitive values (`string`, `boolean` or `number`) are reflected as attributes.\n\n- Vue also automatically casts props declared with `Boolean` or `Number` types into the desired type when they are set as attributes (which are always strings). For example, given the following props declaration:\n\n  ``` js\n  props: {\n    selected: Boolean,\n    index: Number\n  }\n  ```\n\n  And the custom element usage:\n\n  ``` template\n  <my-element selected index=\"1\"></my-element>\n  ```\n\n  In the component, `selected` will be cast to `true` (boolean) and `index` will be cast to `1` (number).\n\n#### Events\n\nEvents emitted via `this.$emit` or setup `emit` are dispatched as native [CustomEvents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events#adding_custom_data_%E2%80%93_customevent) on the custom element. Additional event arguments (payload) will be exposed as an array on the CustomEvent object as its `detail` property.\n\n#### Slots\n\nInside the component, slots can be rendered using the `<slot/>` element as usual. However, when consuming the resulting element, it only accepts [native slots syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots):\n\n- [Scoped slots](../components/slots#scoped-slots) are not supported.\n\n- When passing named slots, use the `slot` attribute instead of the `v-slot` directive:\n\n  ``` template\n  <my-element>\n    <div slot=\"named\">hello</div>\n  </my-element>\n  ```\n\n#### Provide / Inject\n\nThe [Provide / Inject API](../components/provide-inject#provide-inject) and its [Composition API equivalent](../../api/composition-api-dependency-injection#provide) also work between Vue-defined custom elements. However, note that this works **only between custom elements**. i.e. a Vue-defined custom element won't be able to inject properties provided by a non-custom-element Vue component.\n\n### SFC as Custom Element\n\n`defineCustomElement` also works with Vue Single-File Components (SFCs). However, with the default tooling setup, the `<style>` inside the SFCs will still be extracted and merged into a single CSS file during production build. When using an SFC as a custom element, it is often desirable to inject the `<style>` tags into the custom element's shadow root instead.\n\nThe official SFC toolings support importing SFCs in \"custom element mode\" (requires `@vitejs/plugin-vue@^1.4.0` or `vue-loader@^16.5.0`). An SFC loaded in custom element mode inlines its `<style>` tags as strings of CSS and exposes them under the component's `styles` option. This will be picked up by `defineCustomElement` and injected into the element's shadow root when instantiated.\n\nTo opt-in to this mode, simply end your component file name with `.ce.vue`:\n\n``` js\nimport { defineCustomElement } from 'vue'\nimport Example from './Example.ce.vue'\n\nconsole.log(Example.styles) // [\"/* inlined css */\"]\n\n// convert into custom element constructor\nconst ExampleElement = defineCustomElement(Example)\n\n// register\ncustomElements.define('my-example', ExampleElement)\n```\n\nIf you wish to customize what files should be imported in custom element mode (for example, treating *all* SFCs as custom elements), you can pass the `customElement` option to the respective build plugins:\n\n- [@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#using-vue-sfcs-as-custom-elements)\n- [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/tree/next#v16-only-options)\n\n### Tips for a Vue Custom Elements Library\n\nWhen building custom elements with Vue, the elements will rely on Vue's runtime. There is a ~16kb baseline size cost depending on how many features are being used. This means it is not ideal to use Vue if you are shipping a single custom element - you may want to use vanilla JavaScript, [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue), or frameworks that specialize in small runtime size. However, the base size is more than justifiable if you are shipping a collection of custom elements with complex logic, as Vue will allow each component to be authored with much less code. The more elements you are shipping together, the better the trade-off.\n\nIf the custom elements will be used in an application that is also using Vue, you can choose to externalize Vue from the built bundle so that the elements will be using the same copy of Vue from the host application.\n\nIt is recommended to export the individual element constructors to give your users the flexibility to import them on-demand and register them with desired tag names. You can also export a convenience function to automatically register all elements. Here's an example entry point of a Vue custom element library:\n\n``` js\nimport { defineCustomElement } from 'vue'\nimport Foo from './MyFoo.ce.vue'\nimport Bar from './MyBar.ce.vue'\n\nconst MyFoo = defineCustomElement(Foo)\nconst MyBar = defineCustomElement(Bar)\n\n// export individual elements\nexport { MyFoo, MyBar }\n\nexport function register() {\n  customElements.define('my-foo', MyFoo)\n  customElements.define('my-bar', MyBar)\n}\n```\n\nIf you have many components, you can also leverage build tool features such as Vite's [glob import](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import) or webpack's [`require.context`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext) to load all components from a directory.\n\n### Web Components and Typescript\n\nIf you are developing an application or a library, you may want to [type check](../scaling-up/tooling#typescript) your Vue components, including those that are defined as custom elements.\n\nCustom elements are registered globally using native APIs, so by default they won't have type inference when used in Vue templates. To provide type support for Vue components registered as custom elements, we can register global component typings using the the [`GlobalComponents` interface](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/blob/master/packages/vscode-vue/README.md#usage) in Vue templates and/or in [JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#intrinsic-elements):\n\n``` typescript\nimport { defineCustomElement } from 'vue'\n\n// vue SFC\nimport CounterSFC from './src/components/counter.ce.vue'\n\n// turn component into web components\nexport const Counter = defineCustomElement(CounterSFC)\n\n// register global typings\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  export interface GlobalComponents {\n    'Counter': typeof Counter,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Web Components vs. Vue Components\n\nSome developers believe that framework-proprietary component models should be avoided, and that exclusively using Custom Elements makes an application \"future-proof\". Here we will try to explain why we believe that this is an overly simplistic take on the problem.\n\nThere is indeed a certain level of feature overlap between Custom Elements and Vue Components: they both allow us to define reusable components with data passing, event emitting, and lifecycle management. However, Web Components APIs are relatively low-level and bare-bones. To build an actual application, we need quite a few additional capabilities which the platform does not cover:\n\n- A declarative and efficient templating system;\n\n- A reactive state management system that facilitates cross-component logic extraction and reuse;\n\n- A performant way to render the components on the server and hydrate them on the client (SSR), which is important for SEO and [Web Vitals metrics such as LCP](https://web.dev/vitals/). Native custom elements SSR typically involves simulating the DOM in Node.js and then serializing the mutated DOM, while Vue SSR compiles into string concatenation whenever possible, which is much more efficient.\n\nVue's component model is designed with these needs in mind as a coherent system.\n\nWith a competent engineering team, you could probably build the equivalent on top of native Custom Elements - but this also means you are taking on the long-term maintenance burden of an in-house framework, while losing out on the ecosystem and community benefits of a mature framework like Vue.\n\nThere are also frameworks built using Custom Elements as the basis of their component model, but they all inevitably have to introduce their proprietary solutions to the problems listed above. Using these frameworks entails buying into their technical decisions on how to solve these problems - which, despite what may be advertised, doesn't automatically insulate you from potential future churns.\n\nThere are also some areas where we find custom elements to be limiting:\n\n- Eager slot evaluation hinders component composition. Vue's [scoped slots](../components/slots#scoped-slots) are a powerful mechanism for component composition, which can't be supported by custom elements due to native slots' eager nature. Eager slots also mean the receiving component cannot control when or whether to render a piece of slot content.\n\n- Shipping custom elements with shadow DOM scoped CSS today requires embedding the CSS inside JavaScript so that they can be injected into shadow roots at runtime. They also result in duplicated styles in markup in SSR scenarios. There are [platform features](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/4898/) being worked on in this area - but as of now they are not yet universally supported, and there are still production performance / SSR concerns to be addressed. In the meanwhile, Vue SFCs provide [CSS scoping mechanisms](../../api/sfc-css-features) that support extracting the styles into plain CSS files.\n\nVue will always stay up to date with the latest standards in the web platform, and we will happily leverage whatever the platform provides if it makes our job easier. However, our goal is to provide solutions that work well and work today. That means we have to incorporate new platform features with a critical mindset - and that involves filling the gaps where the standards fall short while that is still the case.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components)"
- name: 51. Animation Techniques  (Extra Topics)
  id: guide/extras/animation
  summary: Vue provides the <Transition> and <TransitionGroup> components for handling enter / leave and list transitions
  description: "# Animation Techniques\n\nVue provides the [`<Transition>`](../built-ins/transition) and [`<TransitionGroup>`](../built-ins/transition-group) components for handling enter / leave and list transitions. However, there are many other ways of using animations on the web, even in a Vue application. Here we will discuss a few additional techniques.\n\n## Class-based Animations\n\nFor elements that are not entering / leaving the DOM, we can trigger animations by dynamically adding a CSS class:\n\n``` js\nconst disabled = ref(false)\n\nfunction warnDisabled() {\n  disabled.value = true\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    disabled.value = false\n  }, 1500)\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      disabled: false\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    warnDisabled() {\n      this.disabled = true\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        this.disabled = false\n      }, 1500)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div :class=\"{ shake: disabled }\">\n  <button @click=\"warnDisabled\">Click me</button>\n  <span v-if=\"disabled\">This feature is disabled!</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n``` css\n.shake {\n  animation: shake 0.82s cubic-bezier(0.36, 0.07, 0.19, 0.97) both;\n  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n}\n\n@keyframes shake {\n  10%,\n  90% {\n    transform: translate3d(-1px, 0, 0);\n  }\n\n  20%,\n  80% {\n    transform: translate3d(2px, 0, 0);\n  }\n\n  30%,\n  50%,\n  70% {\n    transform: translate3d(-4px, 0, 0);\n  }\n\n  40%,\n  60% {\n    transform: translate3d(4px, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## State-driven Animations\n\nSome transition effects can be applied by interpolating values, for instance by binding a style to an element while an interaction occurs. Take this example for instance:\n\n``` js\nconst x = ref(0)\n\nfunction onMousemove(e) {\n  x.value = e.clientX\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      x: 0\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    onMousemove(e) {\n      this.x = e.clientX\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\n<div\n  @mousemove=\"onMousemove\"\n  :style=\"{ backgroundColor: `hsl(${x}, 80%, 50%)` }\"\n  class=\"movearea\"\n>\n  <p>Move your mouse across this div...</p>\n  <p>x: {{ x }}</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n``` css\n.movearea {\n  transition: 0.3s background-color ease;\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to color, you can also use style bindings to animate transform, width, or height. You can even animate SVG paths using spring physics - after all, they are all attribute data bindings:\n\nDrag Me\n\n[Source code](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)\n\n## Animating with Watchers\n\nWith some creativity, we can use watchers to animate anything based on some numerical state. For example, we can animate the number itself:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref, reactive, watch } from 'vue'\nimport gsap from 'gsap'\n\nconst number = ref(0)\nconst tweened = reactive({\n  number: 0\n})\n\nwatch(number, (n) => {\n  gsap.to(tweened, { duration: 0.5, number: Number(n) || 0 })\n})\n```\n\n``` template\nType a number: <input v-model.number=\"number\" />\n<p>{{ tweened.number.toFixed(0) }}</p>\n```\n\n``` js\nimport gsap from 'gsap'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      number: 0,\n      tweened: 0\n    }\n  },\n  watch: {\n    number(n) {\n      gsap.to(this, { duration: 0.5, tweened: Number(n) || 0 })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` template\nType a number: <input v-model.number=\"number\" />\n<p>{{ tweened.toFixed(0) }}</p>\n```\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpNUstygzAM/BWNLyEzBDKd6YWSdHrpsacefSGgJG7xY7BImhL+vTKv9ILllXYlr+jEm3PJpUWRidyXjXIEHql1e2mUdrYh6KDBY8yfoiR1wRiuBZVn6OHYWA0r5q6W2pMv3ISHkBPSlNZ4AtPqAzawC2LRdj3DdEU0WA34qB910sBUnsFWmp6LpRmaRo9UHMLIrGG3h4EBQ/OEbDRpxjx51TYFKWtYKHmOF9WP4Qzs+x22EDoA9NLwmaejC/x+vhBqVxeEfAPIK3WBsi6830lRobZSDDjA580hFIt8roxrCS4bbSuskxFmzhhIAenEy92id1CnzZzfd91szETmZ72rH6zYOej7PA3rYXrKE3GUp//m5KunWx3C5CE6enS0hjZXVKczZXCwdfWyoF79YgZPqBliJ9iGSUTEYlzuRrO9X94a/lUGNTklvBTZvAMpwhYCIMWZyPksTVvjvk9JaXUacq9sSlujFJPnvej/AElH3FQ=)\n\n[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpNUctugzAQ/JWVLyESj6hSL5Sm6qXHnnr0xYENuAXbwus8Svj3GlxIJEvendHMvgb2bkx6cshyVtiyl4b2XMnO6J6gtsLAsdcdbKZwwxVXeJmpCo/CtQQDVwCVIBFtQwzQI7leLRmAct0B+xx28YLQGVFh5aGAjNM3zvRZUNnkizhII7V6w9xTSjqiRtoYBqhcL0hq5c3S5/hu/blKbzfYwbh9LMWVf0W2zusTws60gnDK6OtqEMTaeSGVcQSnpNMVtmmAXzkLAWeQzarCQNkKaz1zkHWysPthWNryjX/IC1bRbgvjWGTG64rssbQqLF3bKUzvHmH6o1aUnFHWDeVw0G31sqJW/mIOT9h5KEw2m7CYhUsmnV/at9XKX3n24v+E5WxdNmfTbieAs4bI2DzLnDI/dVrqLpu4Nz+/a5GzZYls/AM3dcFx)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/animation](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/animation)"
- name: <script setup>
  id: api/sfc-script-setup
  summary: <script setup> is a compile-time syntactic sugar for using Composition API inside Single-File Components (SFCs)
  description: "# \\<script setup\\>\n\n`<script setup>` is a compile-time syntactic sugar for using Composition API inside Single-File Components (SFCs). It is the recommended syntax if you are using both SFCs and Composition API. It provides a number of advantages over the normal `<script>` syntax:\n\n- More succinct code with less boilerplate\n- Ability to declare props and emitted events using pure TypeScript\n- Better runtime performance (the template is compiled into a render function in the same scope, without an intermediate proxy)\n- Better IDE type-inference performance (less work for the language server to extract types from code)\n\n## Basic Syntax\n\nTo opt-in to the syntax, add the `setup` attribute to the `<script>` block:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconsole.log('hello script setup')\n</script>\n```\n\nThe code inside is compiled as the content of the component's `setup()` function. This means that unlike normal `<script>`, which only executes once when the component is first imported, code inside `<script setup>` will **execute every time an instance of the component is created**.\n\n### Top-level bindings are exposed to template\n\nWhen using `<script setup>`, any top-level bindings (including variables, function declarations, and imports) declared inside `<script setup>` are directly usable in the template:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\n// variable\nconst msg = 'Hello!'\n\n// functions\nfunction log() {\n  console.log(msg)\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"log\">{{ msg }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\nImports are exposed in the same fashion. This means you can directly use an imported helper function in template expressions without having to expose it via the `methods` option:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { capitalize } from './helpers'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>{{ capitalize('hello') }}</div>\n</template>\n```\n\n## Reactivity\n\nReactive state needs to be explicitly created using [Reactivity APIs](reactivity-core). Similar to values returned from a `setup()` function, refs are automatically unwrapped when referenced in templates:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"count++\">{{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\n## Using Components\n\nValues in the scope of `<script setup>` can also be used directly as custom component tag names:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <MyComponent />\n</template>\n```\n\nThink of `MyComponent` as being referenced as a variable. If you have used JSX, the mental model is similar here. The kebab-case equivalent `<my-component>` also works in the template - however PascalCase component tags are strongly recommended for consistency. It also helps differentiating from native custom elements.\n\n### Dynamic Components\n\nSince components are referenced as variables instead of registered under string keys, we should use dynamic `:is` binding when using dynamic components inside `<script setup>`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport Foo from './Foo.vue'\nimport Bar from './Bar.vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <component :is=\"Foo\" />\n  <component :is=\"someCondition ? Foo : Bar\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nNote how the components can be used as variables in a ternary expression.\n\n### Recursive Components\n\nAn SFC can implicitly refer to itself via its filename. E.g. a file named `FooBar.vue` can refer to itself as `<FooBar/>` in its template.\n\nNote this has lower priority than imported components. If you have a named import that conflicts with the component's inferred name, you can alias the import:\n\n``` js\nimport { FooBar as FooBarChild } from './components'\n```\n\n### Namespaced Components\n\nYou can use component tags with dots like `<Foo.Bar>` to refer to components nested under object properties. This is useful when you import multiple components from a single file:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport * as Form from './form-components'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <Form.Input>\n    <Form.Label>label</Form.Label>\n  </Form.Input>\n</template>\n```\n\n## Using Custom Directives\n\nGlobally registered custom directives just work as normal. Local custom directives don't need to be explicitly registered with `<script setup>`, but they must follow the naming scheme `vNameOfDirective`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst vMyDirective = {\n  beforeMount: (el) => {\n    // do something with the element\n  }\n}\n</script>\n<template>\n  <h1 v-my-directive>This is a Heading</h1>\n</template>\n```\n\nIf you're importing a directive from elsewhere, it can be renamed to fit the required naming scheme:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { myDirective as vMyDirective } from './MyDirective.js'\n</script>\n```\n\n## defineProps() & defineEmits()\n\nTo declare options like `props` and `emits` with full type inference support, we can use the `defineProps` and `defineEmits` APIs, which are automatically available inside `<script setup>`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst props = defineProps({\n  foo: String\n})\n\nconst emit = defineEmits(['change', 'delete'])\n// setup code\n</script>\n```\n\n- `defineProps` and `defineEmits` are **compiler macros** only usable inside `<script setup>`. They do not need to be imported, and are compiled away when `<script setup>` is processed.\n\n- `defineProps` accepts the same value as the `props` option, while `defineEmits` accepts the same value as the `emits` option.\n\n- `defineProps` and `defineEmits` provide proper type inference based on the options passed.\n\n- The options passed to `defineProps` and `defineEmits` will be hoisted out of setup into module scope. Therefore, the options cannot reference local variables declared in setup scope. Doing so will result in a compile error. However, it *can* reference imported bindings since they are in the module scope as well.\n\n### Type-only props/emit declarations\n\nProps and emits can also be declared using pure-type syntax by passing a literal type argument to `defineProps` or `defineEmits`:\n\n``` ts\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  foo: string\n  bar?: number\n}>()\n\nconst emit = defineEmits<{\n  (e: 'change', id: number): void\n  (e: 'update', value: string): void\n}>()\n\n// 3.3+: alternative, more succinct syntax\nconst emit = defineEmits<{\n  change: [id: number] // named tuple syntax\n  update: [value: string]\n}>()\n```\n\n- `defineProps` or `defineEmits` can only use either runtime declaration OR type declaration. Using both at the same time will result in a compile error.\n\n- When using type declaration, the equivalent runtime declaration is automatically generated from static analysis to remove the need for double declaration and still ensure correct runtime behavior.\n\n  - In dev mode, the compiler will try to infer corresponding runtime validation from the types. For example here `foo: String` is inferred from the `foo: string` type. If the type is a reference to an imported type, the inferred result will be `foo: null` (equal to `any` type) since the compiler does not have information of external files.\n\n  - In prod mode, the compiler will generate the array format declaration to reduce bundle size (the props here will be compiled into `['foo', 'bar']`)\n\n- In version 3.2 and below, the generic type parameter for `defineProps()` were limited to a type literal or a reference to a local interface.\n\n  This limitation has been resolved in 3.3. The latest version of Vue supports referencing imported and a limited set of complex types in the type parameter position. However, because the type to runtime conversion is still AST-based, some complex types that require actual type analysis, e.g. conditional types, are not supported. You can use conditional types for the type of a single prop, but not the entire props object.\n\n### Default props values when using type declaration\n\nOne drawback of the type-only `defineProps` declaration is that it doesn't have a way to provide default values for the props. To resolve this problem, a `withDefaults` compiler macro is also provided:\n\n``` ts\nexport interface Props {\n  msg?: string\n  labels?: string[]\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  msg: 'hello',\n  labels: () => ['one', 'two']\n})\n```\n\nThis will be compiled to equivalent runtime props `default` options. In addition, the `withDefaults` helper provides type checks for the default values, and ensures the returned `props` type has the optional flags removed for properties that do have default values declared.\n\n## defineModel()\n\nThis macro can be used to declare a two-way binding prop that can be consumed via `v-model` from the parent component. Example usage is also discussed in the [Component `v-model`](../guide/components/v-model) guide.\n\nUnder the hood, this macro declares a model prop and a corresponding value update event. If the first argument is a literal string, it will be used as the prop name; Otherwise the prop name will default to `\"modelValue\"`. In both cases, you can also pass an additional object which can include the prop's options and the model ref's value transform options.\n\n``` js\n// declares \"modelValue\" prop, consumed by parent via v-model\nconst model = defineModel()\n// OR: declares \"modelValue\" prop with options\nconst model = defineModel({ type: String })\n\n// emits \"update:modelValue\" when mutated\nmodel.value = 'hello'\n\n// declares \"count\" prop, consumed by parent via v-model:count\nconst count = defineModel('count')\n// OR: declares \"count\" prop with options\nconst count = defineModel('count', { type: Number, default: 0 })\n\nfunction inc() {\n  // emits \"update:count\" when mutated\n  count.value++\n}\n```\n\n### Modifiers and Transformers\n\nTo access modifiers used with the `v-model` directive, we can destructure the return value of `defineModel()` like this:\n\n``` js\nconst [modelValue, modelModifiers] = defineModel()\n\n// corresponds to v-model.trim\nif (modelModifiers.trim) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen a modifier is present, we likely need to transform the value when reading or syncing it back to the parent. We can achieve this by using the `get` and `set` transformer options:\n\n``` js\nconst [modelValue, modelModifiers] = defineModel({\n  // get() omitted as it is not needed here\n  set(value) {\n    // if the .trim modifier is used, return trimmed value\n    if (modelModifiers.trim) {\n      return value.trim()\n    }\n    // otherwise, return the value as-is\n    return value\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Usage with TypeScript\n\nLike `defineProps` and `defineEmits`, `defineModel` can also receive type arguments to specify the types of the model value and the modifiers:\n\n``` ts\nconst modelValue = defineModel<string>()\n//    ^? Ref<string | undefined>\n\n// default model with options, required removes possible undefined values\nconst modelValue = defineModel<string>({ required: true })\n//    ^? Ref<string>\n\nconst [modelValue, modifiers] = defineModel<string, 'trim' | 'uppercase'>()\n//                 ^? Record<'trim' | 'uppercase', true | undefined>\n```\n\n## defineExpose()\n\nComponents using `<script setup>` are **closed by default** - i.e. the public instance of the component, which is retrieved via template refs or `$parent` chains, will **not** expose any of the bindings declared inside `<script setup>`.\n\nTo explicitly expose properties in a `<script setup>` component, use the `defineExpose` compiler macro:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst a = 1\nconst b = ref(2)\n\ndefineExpose({\n  a,\n  b\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nWhen a parent gets an instance of this component via template refs, the retrieved instance will be of the shape `{ a: number, b: number }` (refs are automatically unwrapped just like on normal instances).\n\n## defineOptions()\n\nThis macro can be used to declare component options directly inside `<script setup>` without having to use a separate `<script>` block:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\ndefineOptions({\n  inheritAttrs: false,\n  customOptions: {\n    /* ... */\n  }\n})\n</script>\n```\n\n- Only supported in 3.3+.\n- This is a macro. The options will be hoisted to module scope and cannot access local variables in `<script setup>` that are not literal constants.\n\n## defineSlots()\n\nThis macro can be used to provide type hints to IDEs for slot name and props type checking.\n\n`defineSlots()` only accepts a type parameter and no runtime arguments. The type parameter should be a type literal where the property key is the slot name, and the value type is the slot function. The first argument of the function is the props the slot expects to receive, and its type will be used for slot props in the template. The return type is currently ignored and can be `any`, but we may leverage it for slot content checking in the future.\n\nIt also returns the `slots` object, which is equivalent to the `slots` object exposed on the setup context or returned by `useSlots()`.\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nconst slots = defineSlots<{\n  default(props: { msg: string }): any\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\n- Only supported in 3.3+.\n\n## `useSlots()` & `useAttrs()`\n\nUsage of `slots` and `attrs` inside `<script setup>` should be relatively rare, since you can access them directly as `$slots` and `$attrs` in the template. In the rare case where you do need them, use the `useSlots` and `useAttrs` helpers respectively:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { useSlots, useAttrs } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst attrs = useAttrs()\n</script>\n```\n\n`useSlots` and `useAttrs` are actual runtime functions that return the equivalent of `setupContext.slots` and `setupContext.attrs`. They can be used in normal composition API functions as well.\n\n## Usage alongside normal `<script>`\n\n`<script setup>` can be used alongside normal `<script>`. A normal `<script>` may be needed in cases where we need to:\n\n- Declare options that cannot be expressed in `<script setup>`, for example `inheritAttrs` or custom options enabled via plugins (Can be replaced by [`defineOptions`](sfc-script-setup#defineoptions) in 3.3+).\n- Declaring named exports.\n- Run side effects or create objects that should only execute once.\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\n// normal <script>, executed in module scope (only once)\nrunSideEffectOnce()\n\n// declare additional options\nexport default {\n  inheritAttrs: false,\n  customOptions: {}\n}\n</script>\n\n<script setup>\n// executed in setup() scope (for each instance)\n</script>\n```\n\nSupport for combining `<script setup>` and `<script>` in the same component is limited to the scenarios described above. Specifically:\n\n- Do **NOT** use a separate `<script>` section for options that can already be defined using `<script setup>`, such as `props` and `emits`.\n- Variables created inside `<script setup>` are not added as properties to the component instance, making them inaccessible from the Options API. Mixing APIs in this way is strongly discouraged.\n\nIf you find yourself in one of the scenarios that is not supported then you should consider switching to an explicit [`setup()`](composition-api-setup) function, instead of using `<script setup>`.\n\n## Top-level `await`\n\nTop-level `await` can be used inside `<script setup>`. The resulting code will be compiled as `async setup()`:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst post = await fetch(`/api/post/1`).then((r) => r.json())\n</script>\n```\n\nIn addition, the awaited expression will be automatically compiled in a format that preserves the current component instance context after the `await`.\n\n**Note**\n\n`async setup()` must be used in combination with `Suspense`, which is currently still an experimental feature. We plan to finalize and document it in a future release - but if you are curious now, you can refer to its [tests](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/runtime-core/__tests__/components/Suspense.spec.ts) to see how it works.\n\n## Generics\n\nGeneric type parameters can be declared using the `generic` attribute on the `<script>` tag:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup lang=\"ts\" generic=\"T\">\ndefineProps<{\n  items: T[]\n  selected: T\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\nThe value of `generic` works exactly the same as the parameter list between `<...>` in TypeScript. For example, you can use multiple parameters, `extends` constraints, default types, and reference imported types:\n\n``` javascript\n<script\n  setup\n  lang=\"ts\"\n  generic=\"T extends string | number, U extends Item\"\n>\nimport type { Item } from './types'\ndefineProps<{\n  id: T\n  list: U[]\n}>()\n</script>\n```\n\n## Restrictions\n\n- Due to the difference in module execution semantics, code inside `<script setup>` relies on the context of an SFC. When moved into external `.js` or `.ts` files, it may lead to confusion for both developers and tools. Therefore, **`<script setup>`** cannot be used with the `src` attribute.\n- `<script setup>` does not support In-DOM Root Component Template.([Related Discussion](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/8391))\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup)"

    ## cloneVNode()

    Clones a vnode.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function cloneVNode(vnode: VNode, extraProps?: object): VNode
      ```

    - **Details**

      Returns a cloned vnode, optionally with extra props to merge with the original.

      Vnodes should be considered immutable once created, and you should not mutate the props of an existing vnode. Instead, clone it with different / extra props.

      Vnodes have special internal properties, so cloning them is not as simple as an object spread. `cloneVNode()` handles most of the internal logic.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      import { h, cloneVNode } from 'vue'

      const original = h('div')
      const cloned = cloneVNode(original, { id: 'foo' })

    ## ExtractPropTypes\<T\>

    Extract prop types from a runtime props options object. The extracted types are internal facing - i.e. the resolved props received by the component. This means boolean props and props with default values are always defined, even if they are not required.

    To extract public facing props, i.e. props that the parent is allowed to pass, use [`ExtractPublicPropTypes`](#extractpublicproptypes).

    - **Example**

      ``` ts
      const propsOptions = {
        foo: String,
        bar: Boolean,
        baz: {
          type: Number,
          required: true
        },
        qux: {
          type: Number,
          default: 1
        }
      } as const

      type Props = ExtractPropTypes<typeof propsOptions>
      // {
      //   foo?: string,
      //   bar: boolean,
      //   baz: number,

    ## h()

    Creates virtual DOM nodes (vnodes).

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      // full signature
      function h(
        type: string | Component,
        props?: object | null,
        children?: Children | Slot | Slots
      ): VNode

      // omitting props
      function h(type: string | Component, children?: Children | Slot): VNode

      type Children = string | number | boolean | VNode | null | Children[]

      type Slot = () => Children

      type Slots = { [name: string]: Slot }
      ```

      > Types are simplified for readability.

    - **Details**

      The first argument can either be a string (for native elements) or a Vue component definition. The second argument is the props to be passed, and the third argument is the children.

      When creating a component vnode, the children must be passed as slot functions. A single slot function can be passed if the component expects only the default slot. Otherwise, the slots must be passed as an object of slot functions.

      For convenience, the props argument can be omitted when the children is not a slots object.

    - **Example**

      Creating native elements:

      ``` js
      import { h } from 'vue'

      // all arguments except the type are optional
      h('div')
      h('div', { id: 'foo' })

      // both attributes and properties can be used in props
      // Vue automatically picks the right way to assign it
      h('div', { class: 'bar', innerHTML: 'hello' })

      // class and style have the same object / array
      // value support like in templates
      h('div', { class: [foo, { bar }], style: { color: 'red' } })

      // event listeners should be passed as onXxx
      h('div', { onClick: () => {} })

      // children can be a string
      h('div', { id: 'foo' }, 'hello')

      // props can be omitted when there are no props
      h('div', 'hello')
      h('div', [h('span', 'hello')])

      // children array can contain mixed vnodes and strings
      h('div', ['hello', h('span', 'hello')])
      ```

      Creating components:

      ``` js

    ## mergeProps()

    Merge multiple props objects with special handling for certain props.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function mergeProps(...args: object[]): object
      ```

    - **Details**

      `mergeProps()` supports merging multiple props objects with special handling for the following props:

      - `class`
      - `style`
      - `onXxx` event listeners - multiple listeners with the same name will be merged into an array.

      If you do not need the merge behavior and want simple overwrites, native object spread can be used instead.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      import { mergeProps } from 'vue'

      const one = {
        class: 'foo',
        onClick: handlerA
      }

      const two = {
        class: { bar: true },
        onClick: handlerB
      }

      const merged = mergeProps(one, two)
      /**
       {
         class: 'foo bar',
         onClick: [handlerA, handlerB]

      ```

      ### SSR Context

      You can pass an optional context object, which can be used to record additional data during the render, for example [accessing content of Teleports](../guide/scaling-up/ssr#teleports):

      ``` js
      const ctx = {}
      const html = await renderToString(app, ctx)

      console.log(ctx.teleports) // { '#teleported': 'teleported content' }
      ```

      Most other SSR APIs on this page also optionally accept a context object. The context object can be accessed in component code via the [useSSRContext](#usessrcontext) helper.

Returns the root component instance.\n\n  If the component has a template or a render function defined, it will replace any existing DOM nodes inside the container. Otherwise, if the runtime compiler is available, the `innerHTML` of the container will be used as the template.\n\n  In SSR hydration mode, it will hydrate the existing DOM nodes inside the container. If there are [mismatches](../guide/scaling-up/ssr#hydration-mismatch), the existing DOM nodes will be morphed to match the expected output.\n\n  For each app instance, `mount()` can only be called once.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { createApp } from 'vue'\n  const app = createApp(/* ... */)\n\n  app.mount('#app')\n  ```\n\n  Can also mount to an actual DOM element:\n\n  ``` js\n  app.mount(document.body.firstChild)\n  ```\n\n## app.unmount()\n\nUnmounts a mounted application instance, triggering the unmount lifecycle hooks for all components in the application's component tree.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    unmount(): void\n  }\n  ```\n\n## app.component()\n\nRegisters a global component if passing both a name string and a component definition, or retrieves an already registered one if only the name is passed.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    component(name: string): Component | undefined\n    component(name: string, component: Component): this\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\n  const app = createApp({})\n\n  // register an options object\n  app.component('my-component', {\n    /* ... */\n  })\n\n  // retrieve a registered component\n  const MyComponent = app.component('my-component')\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Component Registration](../guide/components/registration)\n\n## app.directive()\n\nRegisters a global custom directive if passing both a name string and a directive definition, or retrieves an already registered one if only the name is passed.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    directive(name: string): Directive | undefined\n    directive(name: string, directive: Directive): this\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\n  const app = createApp({\n    /* ... */\n  })\n\n  // register (object directive)\n  app.directive('my-directive', {\n    /* custom directive hooks */\n  })\n\n  // register (function directive shorthand)\n  app.directive('my-directive', () => {\n    /* ... */\n  })\n\n  // retrieve a registered directive\n  const myDirective = app.directive('my-directive')\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Custom Directives](../guide/reusability/custom-directives)\n\n## app.use()\n\nInstalls a [plugin](../guide/reusability/plugins).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    use(plugin: Plugin, ...options: any[]): this\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Expects the plugin as the first argument, and optional plugin options as the second argument.\n\n  The plugin can either be an object with an `install()` method, or just a function that will be used as the `install()` method. The options (second argument of `app.use()`) will be passed along to the plugin's `install()` method.\n\n  When `app.use()` is called on the same plugin multiple times, the plugin will be installed only once.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { createApp } from 'vue'\n  import MyPlugin from './plugins/MyPlugin'\n\n  const app = createApp({\n    /* ... */\n  })\n\n  app.use(MyPlugin)\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Plugins](../guide/reusability/plugins)\n\n## app.mixin()\n\nApplies a global mixin (scoped to the application). A global mixin applies its included options to every component instance in the application.\n\n**Not Recommended**\n\nMixins are supported in Vue 3 mainly for backwards compatibility, due to their widespread use in ecosystem libraries. Use of mixins, especially global mixins, should be avoided in application code.\n\nFor logic reuse, prefer [Composables](../guide/reusability/composables) instead.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    mixin(mixin: ComponentOptions): this\n  }\n  ```\n\n## app.provide()\n\nProvide a value that can be injected in all descendant components within the application.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    provide<T>(key: InjectionKey<T> | symbol | string, value: T): this\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Expects the injection key as the first argument, and the provided value as the second. Returns the application instance itself.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\n  const app = createApp(/* ... */)\n\n  app.provide('message', 'hello')\n  ```\n\n  Inside a component in the application:\n\n  ``` js\n  import { inject } from 'vue'\n\n  export default {\n    setup() {\n      console.log(inject('message')) // 'hello'\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    inject: ['message'],\n    created() {\n      console.log(this.message) // 'hello'\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Provide / Inject](../guide/components/provide-inject)\n  - [App-level Provide](../guide/components/provide-inject#app-level-provide)\n  - [app.runWithContext()](#app-runwithcontext)\n\n## app.runWithContext()\n\nExecute a callback with the current app as injection context.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    runWithContext<T>(fn: () => T): T\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Expects a callback function and runs the callback immediately. During the synchronous call of the callback, `inject()` calls are able to look up injections from the values provided by the current app, even when there is no current active component instance. The return value of the callback will also be returned.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { inject } from 'vue'\n\n  app.provide('id', 1)\n\n  const injected = app.runWithContext(() => {\n    return inject('id')\n  })\n\n  console.log(injected) // 1\n  ```\n\n## app.version\n\nProvides the version of Vue that the application was created with. This is useful inside [plugins](../guide/reusability/plugins), where you might need conditional logic based on different Vue versions.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface App {\n    version: string\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Performing a version check inside a plugin:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    install(app) {\n      const version = Number(app.version.split('.')[0])\n      if (version < 3) {\n        console.warn('This plugin requires Vue 3')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Global API - version](general#version)\n\n## app.config\n\nEvery application instance exposes a `config` object that contains the configuration settings for that application. You can modify its properties (documented below) before mounting your application.\n\n``` js\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp(/* ... */)\n\nconsole.log(app.config)\n```\n\n## app.config.errorHandler\n\nAssign a global handler for uncaught errors propagating from within the application.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface AppConfig {\n    errorHandler?: (\n      err: unknown,\n      instance: ComponentPublicInstance | null,\n      // `info` is a Vue-specific error info,\n      // e.g. which lifecycle hook the error was thrown in\n      info: string\n    ) => void\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The error handler receives three arguments: the error, the component instance that triggered the error, and an information string specifying the error source type.\n\n  It can capture errors from the following sources:\n\n  - Component renders\n  - Event handlers\n  - Lifecycle hooks\n  - `setup()` function\n  - Watchers\n  - Custom directive hooks\n  - Transition hooks\n\n  **TIP**\n  In production, the 3rd argument (`info`) will be a shortened code instead of the full information string. You can find the code to string mapping in the [Production Error Code Reference](https://vuejs.org/error-reference/#runtime-errors).\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  app.config.errorHandler = (err, instance, info) => {\n    // handle error, e.g. report to a service\n  }\n  ```\n\n## app.config.warnHandler\n\nAssign a custom handler for runtime warnings from Vue.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface AppConfig {\n    warnHandler?: (\n      msg: string,\n      instance: ComponentPublicInstance | null,\n      trace: string\n    ) => void\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The warning handler receives the warning message as the first argument, the source component instance as the second argument, and a component trace string as the third.\n\n  It can be used to filter out specific warnings to reduce console verbosity. All Vue warnings should be addressed during development, so this is only recommended during debug sessions to focus on specific warnings among many, and should be removed once the debugging is done.\n\n  **TIP**\n  Warnings only work during development, so this config is ignored in production mode.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  app.config.warnHandler = (msg, instance, trace) => {\n    // `trace` is the component hierarchy trace\n  }\n  ```\n\n## app.config.performance\n\nSet this to `true` to enable component init, compile, render and patch performance tracing in the browser devtool performance/timeline panel. Only works in development mode and in browsers that support the [performance.mark](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark) API.\n\n- **Type:** `boolean`\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Performance](../guide/best-practices/performance)\n\n## app.config.compilerOptions\n\nConfigure runtime compiler options. Values set on this object will be passed to the in-browser template compiler and affect every component in the configured app. Note you can also override these options on a per-component basis using the [`compilerOptions` option](options-rendering#compileroptions).\n\n**Important**\n\nThis config option is only respected when using the full build (i.e. the standalone `vue.js` that can compile templates in the browser). If you are using the runtime-only build with a build setup, compiler options must be passed to `@vue/compiler-dom` via build tool configurations instead.\n\n- For `vue-loader`: [pass via the `compilerOptions` loader option](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/options.html#compileroptions). Also see [how to configure it in `vue-cli`](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html#modifying-options-of-a-loader).\n\n- For `vite`: [pass via `@vitejs/plugin-vue` options](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#options).\n\n### app.config.compilerOptions.isCustomElement\n\nSpecifies a check method to recognize native custom elements.\n\n- **Type:** `(tag: string) => boolean`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Should return `true` if the tag should be treated as a native custom element. For a matched tag, Vue will render it as a native element instead of attempting to resolve it as a Vue component.\n\n  Native HTML and SVG tags don't need to be matched in this function - Vue's parser recognizes them automatically.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  // treat all tags starting with 'ion-' as custom elements\n  app.config.compilerOptions.isCustomElement = (tag) => {\n    return tag.startsWith('ion-')\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Vue and Web Components](../guide/extras/web-components)\n\n### app.config.compilerOptions.whitespace\n\nAdjusts template whitespace handling behavior.\n\n- **Type:** `'condense' | 'preserve'`\n\n- **Default:** `'condense'`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Vue removes / condenses whitespace characters in templates to produce more efficient compiled output. The default strategy is \"condense\", with the following behavior:\n\n  1.  Leading / ending whitespace characters inside an element are condensed into a single space.\n  2.  Whitespace characters between elements that contain newlines are removed.\n  3.  Consecutive whitespace characters in text nodes are condensed into a single space.\n\n  Setting this option to `'preserve'` will disable (2) and (3).\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  app.config.compilerOptions.whitespace = 'preserve'\n  ```\n\n### app.config.compilerOptions.delimiters\n\nAdjusts the delimiters used for text interpolation within the template.\n\n- **Type:** `[string, string]`\n\n- **Default:** `['{{', '}}']`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  This is typically used to avoid conflicting with server-side frameworks that also use mustache syntax.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  // Delimiters changed to ES6 template string style\n  app.config.compilerOptions.delimiters = ['${', '}']\n  ```\n\n### app.config.compilerOptions.comments\n\nAdjusts treatment of HTML comments in templates.\n\n- **Type:** `boolean`\n\n- **Default:** `false`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  By default, Vue will remove the comments in production. Setting this option to `true` will force Vue to preserve comments even in production. Comments are always preserved during development. This option is typically used when Vue is used with other libraries that rely on HTML comments.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  app.config.compilerOptions.comments = true\n  ```\n\n## app.config.globalProperties\n\nAn object that can be used to register global properties that can be accessed on any component instance inside the application.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface AppConfig {\n    globalProperties: Record<string, any>\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  This is a replacement of Vue 2's `Vue.prototype` which is no longer present in Vue 3. As with anything global, this should be used sparingly.\n\n  If a global property conflicts with a component’s own property, the component's own property will have higher priority.\n\n- **Usage**\n\n  ``` js\n  app.config.globalProperties.msg = 'hello'\n  ```\n\n  This makes `msg` available inside any component template in the application, and also on `this` of any component instance:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    mounted() {\n      console.log(this.msg) // 'hello'\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Augmenting Global Properties](../guide/typescript/options-api#augmenting-global-properties)\n\n## app.config.optionMergeStrategies\n\nAn object for defining merging strategies for custom component options.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface AppConfig {\n    optionMergeStrategies: Record<string, OptionMergeFunction>\n  }\n\n  type OptionMergeFunction = (to: unknown, from: unknown) => any\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Some plugins / libraries add support for custom component options (by injecting global mixins). These options may require special merging logic when the same option needs to be \"merged\" from multiple sources (e.g. mixins or component inheritance).\n\n  A merge strategy function can be registered for a custom option by assigning it on the `app.config.optionMergeStrategies` object using the option's name as the key.\n\n  The merge strategy function receives the value of that option defined on the parent and child instances as the first and second arguments, respectively.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const app = createApp({\n    // option from self\n    msg: 'Vue',\n    // option from a mixin\n    mixins: [\n      {\n        msg: 'Hello '\n      }\n    ],\n    mounted() {\n      // merged options exposed on this.$options\n      console.log(this.$options.msg)\n    }\n  })\n\n  // define a custom merge strategy for `msg`\n  app.config.optionMergeStrategies.msg = (parent, child) => {\n    return (parent || '') + (child || '')\n  }\n\n  app.mount('#app')\n  // logs 'Hello Vue'\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Component Instance - `$options`](component-instance#options)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/application](https://vuejs.org/api/application)"

  summary: Built-in components can be used directly in templates without needing to be registered
  description: "# Built-in Components\n\n**Registration and Usage**\n\nBuilt-in components can be used directly in templates without needing to be registered. They are also tree-shakeable: they are only included in the build when they are used.\n\nWhen using them in [render functions](../guide/extras/render-function), they need to be imported explicitly. For example:\n\n``` js\nimport { h, Transition } from 'vue'\n\nh(Transition, {\n  /* props */\n})\n```\n\n## `<Transition>`\n\nProvides animated transition effects to a **single** element or component.\n\n- **Props**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface TransitionProps {\n    /**\n     * Used to automatically generate transition CSS class names.\n     * e.g. `name: 'fade'` will auto expand to `.fade-enter`,\n     * `.fade-enter-active`, etc.\n     */\n    name?: string\n    /**\n     * Whether to apply CSS transition classes.\n     * Default: true\n     */\n    css?: boolean\n    /**\n     * Specifies the type of transition events to wait for to\n     * determine transition end timing.\n     * Default behavior is auto detecting the type that has\n     * longer duration.\n     */\n    type?: 'transition' | 'animation'\n    /**\n     * Specifies explicit durations of the transition.\n     * Default behavior is wait for the first `transitionend`\n     * or `animationend` event on the root transition element.\n     */\n    duration?: number | { enter: number; leave: number }\n    /**\n     * Controls the timing sequence of leaving/entering transitions.\n     * Default behavior is simultaneous.\n     */\n    mode?: 'in-out' | 'out-in' | 'default'\n    /**\n     * Whether to apply transition on initial render.\n     * Default: false\n     */\n    appear?: boolean\n\n    /**\n     * Props for customizing transition classes.\n     * Use kebab-case in templates, e.g. enter-from-class=\"xxx\"\n     */\n    enterFromClass?: string\n    enterActiveClass?: string\n    enterToClass?: string\n    appearFromClass?: string\n    appearActiveClass?: string\n    appearToClass?: string\n    leaveFromClass?: string\n    leaveActiveClass?: string\n    leaveToClass?: string\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Events**\n\n  - `@before-enter`\n  - `@before-leave`\n  - `@enter`\n  - `@leave`\n  - `@appear`\n  - `@after-enter`\n  - `@after-leave`\n  - `@after-appear`\n  - `@enter-cancelled`\n  - `@leave-cancelled` (`v-show` only)\n  - `@appear-cancelled`\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Simple element:\n\n  ``` template\n  <Transition>\n    <div v-if=\"ok\">toggled content</div>\n  </Transition>\n  ```\n\n  Forcing a transition by changing the `key` attribute:\n\n  ``` template\n  <Transition>\n    <div :key=\"text\">{{ text }}</div>\n  </Transition>\n  ```\n\n  Dynamic component, with transition mode + animate on appear:\n\n  ``` template\n  <Transition name=\"fade\" mode=\"out-in\" appear>\n    <component :is=\"view\"></component>\n  </Transition>\n  ```\n\n  Listening to transition events:\n\n  ``` template\n  <Transition @after-enter=\"onTransitionComplete\">\n    <div v-show=\"ok\">toggled content</div>\n  </Transition>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Transition](../guide/built-ins/transition)\n\n## `<TransitionGroup>`\n\nProvides transition effects for **multiple** elements or components in a list.\n\n- **Props**\n\n  `<TransitionGroup>` accepts the same props as `<Transition>` except `mode`, plus two additional props:\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface TransitionGroupProps extends Omit<TransitionProps, 'mode'> {\n    /**\n     * If not defined, renders as a fragment.\n     */\n    tag?: string\n    /**\n     * For customizing the CSS class applied during move transitions.\n     * Use kebab-case in templates, e.g. move-class=\"xxx\"\n     */\n    moveClass?: string\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Events**\n\n  `<TransitionGroup>` emits the same events as `<Transition>`.\n\n- **Details**\n\n  By default, `<TransitionGroup>` doesn't render a wrapper DOM element, but one can be defined via the `tag` prop.\n\n  Note that every child in a `<transition-group>` must be [**uniquely keyed**](../guide/essentials/list#maintaining-state-with-key) for the animations to work properly.\n\n  `<TransitionGroup>` supports moving transitions via CSS transform. When a child's position on screen has changed after an update, it will get applied a moving CSS class (auto generated from the `name` attribute or configured with the `move-class` prop). If the CSS `transform` property is \"transition-able\" when the moving class is applied, the element will be smoothly animated to its destination using the [FLIP technique](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/).\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <TransitionGroup tag=\"ul\" name=\"slide\">\n    <li v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\">\n      {{ item.text }}\n    </li>\n  </TransitionGroup>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - TransitionGroup](../guide/built-ins/transition-group)\n\n## `<KeepAlive>`\n\nCaches dynamically toggled components wrapped inside.\n\n- **Props**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface KeepAliveProps {\n    /**\n     * If specified, only components with names matched by\n     * `include` will be cached.\n     */\n    include?: MatchPattern\n    /**\n     * Any component with a name matched by `exclude` will\n     * not be cached.\n     */\n    exclude?: MatchPattern\n    /**\n     * The maximum number of component instances to cache.\n     */\n    max?: number | string\n  }\n\n  type MatchPattern = string | RegExp | (string | RegExp)[]\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  When wrapped around a dynamic component, `<KeepAlive>` caches the inactive component instances without destroying them.\n\n  There can only be one active component instance as the direct child of `<KeepAlive>` at any time.\n\n  When a component is toggled inside `<KeepAlive>`, its `activated` and `deactivated` lifecycle hooks will be invoked accordingly, providing an alternative to `mounted` and `unmounted`, which are not called. This applies to the direct child of `<KeepAlive>` as well as to all of its descendants.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Basic usage:\n\n  ``` template\n  <KeepAlive>\n    <component :is=\"view\"></component>\n  </KeepAlive>\n  ```\n\n  When used with `v-if` / `v-else` branches, there must be only one component rendered at a time:\n\n  ``` template\n  <KeepAlive>\n    <comp-a v-if=\"a > 1\"></comp-a>\n    <comp-b v-else></comp-b>\n  </KeepAlive>\n  ```\n\n  Used together with `<Transition>`:\n\n  ``` template\n  <Transition>\n    <KeepAlive>\n      <component :is=\"view\"></component>\n    </KeepAlive>\n  </Transition>\n  ```\n\n  Using `include` / `exclude`:\n\n  ``` template\n  <!-- comma-delimited string -->\n  <KeepAlive include=\"a,b\">\n    <component :is=\"view\"></component>\n  </KeepAlive>\n\n  <!-- regex (use `v-bind`) -->\n  <KeepAlive :include=\"/a|b/\">\n    <component :is=\"view\"></component>\n  </KeepAlive>\n\n  <!-- Array (use `v-bind`) -->\n  <KeepAlive :include=\"['a', 'b']\">\n    <component :is=\"view\"></component>\n  </KeepAlive>\n  ```\n\n  Usage with `max`:\n\n  ``` template\n  <KeepAlive :max=\"10\">\n    <component :is=\"view\"></component>\n  </KeepAlive>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - KeepAlive](../guide/built-ins/keep-alive)\n\n## `<Teleport>`\n\nRenders its slot content to another part of the DOM.\n\n- **Props**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface TeleportProps {\n    /**\n     * Required. Specify target container.\n     * Can either be a selector or an actual element.\n     */\n    to: string | HTMLElement\n    /**\n     * When `true`, the content will remain in its original\n     * location instead of moved into the target container.\n     * Can be changed dynamically.\n     */\n    disabled?: boolean\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Specifying target container:\n\n  ``` template\n  <Teleport to=\"#some-id\" />\n  <Teleport to=\".some-class\" />\n  <Teleport to=\"[data-teleport]\" />\n  ```\n\n  Conditionally disabling:\n\n  ``` template\n  <Teleport to=\"#popup\" :disabled=\"displayVideoInline\">\n    <video src=\"./my-movie.mp4\">\n  </Teleport>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Teleport](../guide/built-ins/teleport)\n\n## `<Suspense>`\n\nUsed for orchestrating nested async dependencies in a component tree.\n\n- **Props**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface SuspenseProps {\n    timeout?: string | number\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Events**\n\n  - `@resolve`\n  - `@pending`\n  - `@fallback`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `<Suspense>` accepts two slots: the `#default` slot and the `#fallback` slot. It will display the content of the fallback slot while rendering the default slot in memory.\n\n  If it encounters async dependencies ([Async Components](../guide/components/async) and components with [`async setup()`](../guide/built-ins/suspense#async-setup)) while rendering the default slot, it will wait until all of them are resolved before displaying the default slot.\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Suspense](../guide/built-ins/suspense)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-components](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-components)"

  summary: Update the element's text content
  description: "# Built-in Directives\n\n## v-text\n\nUpdate the element's text content.\n\n- **Expects:** `string`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `v-text` works by setting the element's [textContent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) property, so it will overwrite any existing content inside the element. If you need to update the part of `textContent`, you should use [mustache interpolations](../guide/essentials/template-syntax#text-interpolation) instead.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <span v-text=\"msg\"></span>\n  <!-- same as -->\n  <span>{{msg}}</span>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Template Syntax - Text Interpolation](../guide/essentials/template-syntax#text-interpolation)\n\n## v-html\n\nUpdate the element's [innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML).\n\n- **Expects:** `string`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Contents of `v-html` are inserted as plain HTML - Vue template syntax will not be processed. If you find yourself trying to compose templates using `v-html`, try to rethink the solution by using components instead.\n\n  **Security Note**\n  Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to [XSS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Only use `v-html` on trusted content and **never** on user-provided content.\n\n  In [Single-File Components](../guide/scaling-up/sfc), `scoped` styles will not apply to content inside `v-html`, because that HTML is not processed by Vue's template compiler. If you want to target `v-html` content with scoped CSS, you can instead use [CSS modules](sfc-css-features#css-modules) or an additional, global `<style>` element with a manual scoping strategy such as BEM.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <div v-html=\"html\"></div>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Template Syntax - Raw HTML](../guide/essentials/template-syntax#raw-html)\n\n## v-show\n\nToggle the element's visibility based on the truthy-ness of the expression value.\n\n- **Expects:** `any`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `v-show` works by setting the `display` CSS property via inline styles, and will try to respect the initial `display` value when the element is visible. It also triggers transitions when its condition changes.\n\n- **See also** [Conditional Rendering - v-show](../guide/essentials/conditional#v-show)\n\n## v-if\n\nConditionally render an element or a template fragment based on the truthy-ness of the expression value.\n\n- **Expects:** `any`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  When a `v-if` element is toggled, the element and its contained directives / components are destroyed and re-constructed. If the initial condition is falsy, then the inner content won't be rendered at all.\n\n  Can be used on `<template>` to denote a conditional block containing only text or multiple elements.\n\n  This directive triggers transitions when its condition changes.\n\n  When used together, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`. We don't recommend using these two directives together on one element — see the [list rendering guide](../guide/essentials/list#v-for-with-v-if) for details.\n\n- **See also** [Conditional Rendering - v-if](../guide/essentials/conditional#v-if)\n\n## v-else\n\nDenote the \"else block\" for `v-if` or a `v-if` / `v-else-if` chain.\n\n- **Does not expect expression**\n\n- **Details**\n\n  - Restriction: previous sibling element must have `v-if` or `v-else-if`.\n\n  - Can be used on `<template>` to denote a conditional block containing only text or multiple elements.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <div v-if=\"Math.random() > 0.5\">\n    Now you see me\n  </div>\n  <div v-else>\n    Now you don't\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Conditional Rendering - v-else](../guide/essentials/conditional#v-else)\n\n## v-else-if\n\nDenote the \"else if block\" for `v-if`.

To force it to reorder elements, you should provide an ordering hint with the `key` special attribute:\n\n  ``` template\n  <div v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\">\n    {{ item.text }}\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  `v-for` can also work on values that implement the [Iterable Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol), including native `Map` and `Set`.\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [List Rendering](../guide/essentials/list)\n\n## v-on\n\nAttach an event listener to the element.\n\n- **Shorthand:** `@`\n\n- **Expects:** `Function | Inline Statement | Object (without argument)`\n\n- **Argument:** `event` (optional if using Object syntax)\n\n- **Modifiers**\n\n  - `.stop` - call `event.stopPropagation()`.\n  - `.prevent` - call `event.preventDefault()`.\n  - `.capture` - add event listener in capture mode.\n  - `.self` - only trigger handler if event was dispatched from this element.\n  - `.{keyAlias}` - only trigger handler on certain keys.\n  - `.once` - trigger handler at most once.\n  - `.left` - only trigger handler for left button mouse events.\n  - `.right` - only trigger handler for right button mouse events.\n  - `.middle` - only trigger handler for middle button mouse events.\n  - `.passive` - attaches a DOM event with `{ passive: true }`.\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The event type is denoted by the argument. The expression can be a method name, an inline statement, or omitted if there are modifiers present.\n\n  When used on a normal element, it listens to [**native DOM events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) only. When used on a custom element component, it listens to **custom events** emitted on that child component.\n\n  When listening to native DOM events, the method receives the native event as the only argument. If using inline statement, the statement has access to the special `$event` property: `v-on:click=\"handle('ok', $event)\"`.\n\n  `v-on` also supports binding to an object of event / listener pairs without an argument. Note when using the object syntax, it does not support any modifiers.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <!-- method handler -->\n  <button v-on:click=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- dynamic event -->\n  <button v-on:[event]=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- inline statement -->\n  <button v-on:click=\"doThat('hello', $event)\"></button>\n\n  <!-- shorthand -->\n  <button @click=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- shorthand dynamic event -->\n  <button @[event]=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- stop propagation -->\n  <button @click.stop=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- prevent default -->\n  <button @click.prevent=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- prevent default without expression -->\n  <form @submit.prevent></form>\n\n  <!-- chain modifiers -->\n  <button @click.stop.prevent=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- key modifier using keyAlias -->\n  <input @keyup.enter=\"onEnter\" />\n\n  <!-- the click event will be triggered at most once -->\n  <button v-on:click.once=\"doThis\"></button>\n\n  <!-- object syntax -->\n  <button v-on=\"{ mousedown: doThis, mouseup: doThat }\"></button>\n  ```\n\n  Listening to custom events on a child component (the handler is called when \"my-event\" is emitted on the child):\n\n  ``` template\n  <MyComponent @my-event=\"handleThis\" />\n\n  <!-- inline statement -->\n  <MyComponent @my-event=\"handleThis(123, $event)\" />\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Event Handling](../guide/essentials/event-handling)\n  - [Components - Custom Events](../guide/essentials/component-basics#listening-to-events)\n\n## v-bind\n\nDynamically bind one or more attributes, or a component prop to an expression.\n\n- **Shorthand:**\n\n  - `:` or `.` (when using `.prop` modifier)\n  - Omitting value (when attribute and bound value has the same name) ^(3.4+)\n\n- **Expects:** `any (with argument) | Object (without argument)`\n\n- **Argument:** `attrOrProp (optional)`\n\n- **Modifiers**\n\n  - `.camel` - transform the kebab-case attribute name into camelCase.\n  - `.prop` - force a binding to be set as a DOM property. ^(3.2+)\n  - `.attr` - force a binding to be set as a DOM attribute. ^(3.2+)\n\n- **Usage**\n\n  When used to bind the `class` or `style` attribute, `v-bind` supports additional value types such as Array or Objects. See linked guide section below for more details.\n\n  When setting a binding on an element, Vue by default checks whether the element has the key defined as a property using an `in` operator check. If the property is defined, Vue will set the value as a DOM property instead of an attribute. This should work in most cases, but you can override this behavior by explicitly using `.prop` or `.attr` modifiers. This is sometimes necessary, especially when [working with custom elements](../guide/extras/web-components#passing-dom-properties).\n\n  When used for component prop binding, the prop must be properly declared in the child component.\n\n  When used without an argument, can be used to bind an object containing attribute name-value pairs.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <!-- bind an attribute -->\n  <img v-bind:src=\"imageSrc\" />\n\n  <!-- dynamic attribute name -->\n  <button v-bind:[key]=\"value\"></button>\n\n  <!-- shorthand -->\n  <img :src=\"imageSrc\" />\n\n  <!-- same-name shorthand (3.4+), expands to :src=\"src\" -->\n  <img :src />\n\n  <!-- shorthand dynamic attribute name -->\n  <button :[key]=\"value\"></button>\n\n  <!-- with inline string concatenation -->\n  <img :src=\"'/path/to/images/' + fileName\" />\n\n  <!-- class binding -->\n  <div :class=\"{ red: isRed }\"></div>\n  <div :class=\"[classA, classB]\"></div>\n  <div :class=\"[classA, { classB: isB, classC: isC }]\"></div>\n\n  <!-- style binding -->\n  <div :style=\"{ fontSize: size + 'px' }\"></div>\n  <div :style=\"[styleObjectA, styleObjectB]\"></div>\n\n  <!-- binding an object of attributes -->\n  <div v-bind=\"{ id: someProp, 'other-attr': otherProp }\"></div>\n\n  <!-- prop binding. \"prop\" must be declared in the child component. -->\n  <MyComponent :prop=\"someThing\" />\n\n  <!-- pass down parent props in common with a child component -->\n  <MyComponent v-bind=\"$props\" />\n\n  <!-- XLink -->\n  <svg><a :xlink:special=\"foo\"></a></svg>\n  ```\n\n  The `.prop` modifier also has a dedicated shorthand, `.`:\n\n  ``` template\n  <div :someProperty.prop=\"someObject\"></div>\n\n  <!-- equivalent to -->\n  <div .someProperty=\"someObject\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  The `.camel` modifier allows camelizing a `v-bind` attribute name when using in-DOM templates, e.g. the SVG `viewBox` attribute:\n\n  ``` template\n  <svg :view-box.camel=\"viewBox\"></svg>\n  ```\n\n  `.camel` is not needed if you are using string templates, or pre-compiling the template with a build step.\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Class and Style Bindings](../guide/essentials/class-and-style)\n  - [Components - Prop Passing Details](../guide/components/props#prop-passing-details)\n\n## v-model\n\nCreate a two-way binding on a form input element or a component.\n\n- **Expects:** varies based on value of form inputs element or output of components\n\n- **Limited to:**\n\n  - `<input>`\n  - `<select>`\n  - `<textarea>`\n  - components\n\n- **Modifiers**\n\n  - [`.lazy`](../guide/essentials/forms#lazy) - listen to `change` events instead of `input`\n  - [`.number`](../guide/essentials/forms#number) - cast valid input string to numbers\n  - [`.trim`](../guide/essentials/forms#trim) - trim input\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Form Input Bindings](../guide/essentials/forms)\n  - [Component Events - Usage with `v-model`](../guide/components/v-model)\n\n## v-slot\n\nDenote named slots or scoped slots that expect to receive props.\n\n- **Shorthand:** `#`\n\n- **Expects:** JavaScript expression that is valid in a function argument position, including support for destructuring. Optional - only needed if expecting props to be passed to the slot.\n\n- **Argument:** slot name (optional, defaults to `default`)\n\n- **Limited to:**\n\n  - `<template>`\n  - [components](../guide/components/slots#scoped-slots) (for a lone default slot with props)\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <!-- Named slots -->\n  <BaseLayout>\n    <template v-slot:header>\n      Header content\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:default>\n      Default slot content\n    </template>\n\n    <template v-slot:footer>\n      Footer content\n    </template>\n  </BaseLayout>\n\n  <!-- Named slot that receives props -->\n  <InfiniteScroll>\n    <template v-slot:item=\"slotProps\">\n      <div class=\"item\">\n        {{ slotProps.item.text }}\n      </div>\n    </template>\n  </InfiniteScroll>\n\n  <!-- Default slot that receive props, with destructuring -->\n  <Mouse v-slot=\"{ x, y }\">\n    Mouse position: {{ x }}, {{ y }}\n  </Mouse>\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Components - Slots](../guide/components/slots)\n\n## v-pre\n\nSkip compilation for this element and all its children.\n\n- **Does not expect expression**\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Inside the element with `v-pre`, all Vue template syntax will be preserved and rendered as-is. The most common use case of this is displaying raw mustache tags.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` template\n  <span v-pre>{{ this will not be compiled }}</span>\n  ```\n\n## v-once\n\nRender the element and component once only, and skip future updates.\n\n- **Does not expect expression**\n\n- **Details**\n\n  On subsequent re-renders, the element/component and all its children will be treated as static content and skipped. This can be used to optimize update performance.\n\n  ``` template\n  <!-- single element -->\n  <span v-once>This will never change: {{msg}}</span>\n  <!-- the element have children -->\n  <div v-once>\n    <h1>comment</h1>\n    <p>{{msg}}</p>\n  </div>\n  <!-- component -->\n  <MyComponent v-once :comment=\"msg\"></MyComponent>\n  <!-- `v-for` directive -->\n  <ul>\n    <li v-for=\"i in list\" v-once>{{i}}</li>\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  Since 3.2, you can also memoize part of the template with invalidation conditions using [`v-memo`](#v-memo).\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Data Binding Syntax - interpolations](../guide/essentials/template-syntax#text-interpolation)\n  - [v-memo](#v-memo)\n\n## v-memo\n\n- **Expects:** `any[]`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Memoize a sub-tree of the template. Can be used on both elements and components. The directive expects a fixed-length array of dependency values to compare for the memoization. If every value in the array was the same as last render, then updates for the entire sub-tree will be skipped. For example:\n\n  ``` template\n  <div v-memo=\"[valueA, valueB]\">\n    ...\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  When the component re-renders, if both `valueA` and `valueB` remain the same, all updates for this `<div>` and its children will be skipped. In fact, even the Virtual DOM VNode creation will also be skipped since the memoized copy of the sub-tree can be reused.\n\n  It is important to specify the memoization array correctly, otherwise we may skip updates that should indeed be applied. `v-memo` with an empty dependency array (`v-memo=\"[]\"`) would be functionally equivalent to `v-once`.\n\n  **Usage with `v-for`**\n\n  `v-memo` is provided solely for micro optimizations in performance-critical scenarios and should be rarely needed. The most common case where this may prove helpful is when rendering large `v-for` lists (where `length > 1000`):\n\n  ``` template\n  <div v-for=\"item in list\" :key=\"item.id\" v-memo=\"[item.id === selected]\">\n    <p>ID: {{ item.id }} - selected: {{ item.id === selected }}</p>\n    <p>...more child nodes</p>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  When the component's `selected` state changes, a large amount of VNodes will be created even though most of the items remained exactly the same. The `v-memo` usage here is essentially saying \"only update this item if it went from non-selected to selected, or the other way around\". This allows every unaffected item to reuse its previous VNode and skip diffing entirely. Note we don't need to include `item.id` in the memo dependency array here since Vue automatically infers it from the item's `:key`.\n\n  **WARNING**\n  When using `v-memo` with `v-for`, make sure they are used on the same element. **`v-memo` does not work inside `v-for`.**\n\n  `v-memo` can also be used on components to manually prevent unwanted updates in certain edge cases where the child component update check has been de-optimized. But again, it is the developer's responsibility to specify correct dependency arrays to avoid skipping necessary updates.\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [v-once](#v-once)\n\n## v-cloak\n\nUsed to hide un-compiled template until it is ready.\n\n- **Does not expect expression**\n\n- **Details**\n\n  **This directive is only needed in no-build-step setups.**\n\n  When using in-DOM templates, there can be a \"flash of un-compiled templates\": the user may see raw mustache tags until the mounted component replaces them with rendered content.\n\n  `v-cloak` will remain on the element until the associated component instance is mounted. Combined with CSS rules such as `[v-cloak] { display: none }`, it can be used to hide the raw templates until the component is ready.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` css\n  [v-cloak] {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ``` template\n  <div v-cloak>\n    {{ message }}\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  The `<div>` will not be visible until the compilation is done.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives)"

  summary: The key special attribute is primarily used as a hint for Vue's virtual DOM algorithm to identify vnodes when diffing the new list of nodes against the old list
  description: "# Built-in Special Attributes\n\n## key\n\nThe `key` special attribute is primarily used as a hint for Vue's virtual DOM algorithm to identify vnodes when diffing the new list of nodes against the old list.\n\n- **Expects:** `number | string | symbol`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Without keys, Vue uses an algorithm that minimizes element movement and tries to patch/reuse elements of the same type in-place as much as possible. With keys, it will reorder elements based on the order change of keys, and elements with keys that are no longer present will always be removed / destroyed.\n\n  Children of the same common parent must have **unique keys**. Duplicate keys will cause render errors.\n\n  The most common use case is combined with `v-for`:\n\n  ``` template\n  <ul>\n    <li v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\">...</li>\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  It can also be used to force replacement of an element/component instead of reusing it. This can be useful when you want to:\n\n  - Properly trigger lifecycle hooks of a component\n  - Trigger transitions\n\n  For example:\n\n  ``` template\n  <transition>\n    <span :key=\"text\">{{ text }}</span>\n  </transition>\n  ```\n\n  When `text` changes, the `<span>` will always be replaced instead of patched, so a transition will be triggered.\n\n- **See also** [Guide - List Rendering - Maintaining State with `key`](../guide/essentials/list#maintaining-state-with-key)\n\n## ref\n\nDenotes a [template ref](../guide/essentials/template-refs).\n\n- **Expects:** `string | Function`\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `ref` is used to register a reference to an element or a child component.\n\n  In Options API, the reference will be registered under the component's `this.$refs` object:\n\n  ``` template\n  <!-- stored as this.$refs.p -->\n  <p ref=\"p\">hello</p>\n  ```\n\n  In Composition API, the reference will be stored in a ref with matching name:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { ref } from 'vue'\n\n  const p = ref()\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <p ref=\"p\">hello</p>\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n  If used on a plain DOM element, the reference will be that element; if used on a child component, the reference will be the child component instance.\n\n  Alternatively `ref` can accept a function value which provides full control over where to store the reference:\n\n  ``` template\n  <ChildComponent :ref=\"(el) => child = el\" />\n  ```\n\n  An important note about the ref registration timing: because the refs themselves are created as a result of the render function, you must wait until the component is mounted before accessing them.\n\n  `this.$refs` is also non-reactive, therefore you should not attempt to use it in templates for data-binding.\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Template Refs](../guide/essentials/template-refs)\n  - [Guide - Typing Template Refs](../guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-template-refs)\n  - [Guide - Typing Component Template Refs](../guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-template-refs)\n\n## is\n\nUsed for binding [dynamic components](../guide/essentials/component-basics#dynamic-components).\n\n- **Expects:** `string | Component`\n\n- **Usage on native elements** ^(3.1+)\n\n  When the `is` attribute is used on a native HTML element, it will be interpreted as a [Customized built-in element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example), which is a native web platform feature.\n\n  There is, however, a use case where you may need Vue to replace a native element with a Vue component, as explained in [in-DOM Template Parsing Caveats](../guide/essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats).

  summary: <component>, <slot> and <template> are component-like features and part of the template syntax
  description: "# Built-in Special Elements\n\n**Not Components**\n\n`<component>`, `<slot>` and `<template>` are component-like features and part of the template syntax. They are not true components and are compiled away during template compilation. As such, they are conventionally written with lowercase in templates.\n\n## `<component>`\n\nA \"meta component\" for rendering dynamic components or elements.\n\n- **Props**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface DynamicComponentProps {\n    is: string | Component\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The actual component to render is determined by the `is` prop.\n\n  - When `is` is a string, it could be either an HTML tag name or a component's registered name.\n\n  - Alternatively, `is` can also be directly bound to the definition of a component.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Rendering components by registered name (Options API):\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script>\n  import Foo from './Foo.vue'\n  import Bar from './Bar.vue'\n\n  export default {\n    components: { Foo, Bar },\n    data() {\n      return {\n        view: 'Foo'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <component :is=\"view\" />\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n  Rendering components by definition (Composition API with `<script setup>`):\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import Foo from './Foo.vue'\n  import Bar from './Bar.vue'\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <component :is=\"Math.random() > 0.5 ? Foo : Bar\" />\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n  Rendering HTML elements:\n\n  ``` template\n  <component :is=\"href ? 'a' : 'span'\"></component>\n  ```\n\n  The [built-in components](built-in-components) can all be passed to `is`, but you must register them if you want to pass them by name. For example:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script>\n  import { Transition, TransitionGroup } from 'vue'\n\n  export default {\n    components: {\n      Transition,\n      TransitionGroup\n    }\n  }\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <component :is=\"isGroup ? 'TransitionGroup' : 'Transition'\">\n      ...\n    </component>\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n  Registration is not required if you pass the component itself to `is` rather than its name, e.g. in `<script setup>`.\n\n  If `v-model` is used on a `<component>` tag, the template compiler will expand it to a `modelValue` prop and `update:modelValue` event listener, much like it would for any other component. However, this won't be compatible with native HTML elements, such as `<input>` or `<select>`. As a result, using `v-model` with a dynamically created native element won't work:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { ref } from 'vue'\n\n  const tag = ref('input')\n  const username = ref('')\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <!-- This won't work as 'input' is a native HTML element -->\n    <component :is=\"tag\" v-model=\"username\" />\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n  In practice, this edge case isn't common as native form fields are typically wrapped in components in real applications. If you do need to use a native element directly then you can split the `v-model` into an attribute and event manually.\n\n- **See also** [Dynamic Components](../guide/essentials/component-basics#dynamic-components)\n\n## `<slot>`\n\nDenotes slot content outlets in templates.\n\n- **Props**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface SlotProps {\n    /**\n     * Any props passed to <slot> to passed as arguments\n     * for scoped slots\n     */\n    [key: string]: any\n    /**\n     * Reserved for specifying slot name.\n     */\n    name?: string\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The `<slot>` element can use the `name` attribute to specify a slot name. When no `name` is specified, it will render the default slot. Additional attributes passed to the slot element will be passed as slot props to the scoped slot defined in the parent.\n\n  The element itself will be replaced by its matched slot content.\n\n  `<slot>` elements in Vue templates are compiled into JavaScript, so they are not to be confused with [native `<slot>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot).\n\n- **See also** [Component - Slots](../guide/components/slots)\n\n## `<template>`\n\nThe `<template>` tag is used as a placeholder when we want to use a built-in directive without rendering an element in the DOM.\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The special handling for `<template>` is only triggered if it is used with one of these directives:\n\n  - `v-if`, `v-else-if`, or `v-else`\n  - `v-for`\n  - `v-slot`\n\n  If none of those directives are present then it will be rendered as a [native `<template>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) instead.\n\n  A `<template>` with a `v-for` can also have a [`key` attribute](built-in-special-attributes#key). All other attributes and directives will be discarded, as they aren't meaningful without a corresponding element.\n\n  Single-file components use a [top-level `<template>` tag](sfc-spec#language-blocks) to wrap the entire template. That usage is separate from the use of `<template>` described above. That top-level tag is not part of the template itself and doesn't support template syntax, such as directives.\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - `v-if` on `<template>`](../guide/essentials/conditional#v-if-on-template)\n  - [Guide - `v-for` on `<template>`](../guide/essentials/list#v-for-on-template)\n  - [Guide - Named slots](../guide/components/slots#named-slots)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-special-elements](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-special-elements)"

    ## `<component>`

    A "meta component" for rendering dynamic components or elements.

    - **Props**

      ``` ts
      interface DynamicComponentProps {
        is: string | Component
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The actual component to render is determined by the `is` prop.

      - When `is` is a string, it could be either an HTML tag name or a component's registered name.

      - Alternatively, `is` can also be directly bound to the definition of a component.

    - **Example**

      Rendering components by registered name (Options API):

      ``` javascript
      <script>
      import Foo from './Foo.vue'
      import Bar from './Bar.vue'

      export default {
        components: { Foo, Bar },
        data() {
          return {
            view: 'Foo'
          }
        }
      }
      </script>

      <template>
        <component :is="view" />
      </template>
      ```

      Rendering components by definition (Composition API with `<script setup>`):

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import Foo from './Foo.vue'
      import Bar from './Bar.vue'
      </script>

      <template>
        <component :is="Math.random() > 0.5 ? Foo : Bar" />
      </template>
      ```

      Rendering HTML elements:

      ``` template
      <component :is="href ? 'a' : 'span'"></component>
      ```

      The [built-in components](built-in-components) can all be passed to `is`, but you must register them if you want to pass them by name. For example:

      ``` javascript
      <script>
      import { Transition, TransitionGroup } from 'vue'

      export default {
        components: {
          Transition,
          TransitionGroup
        }
      }
      </script>

      <template>
        <component :is="isGroup ? 'TransitionGroup' : 'Transition'">
          ...
        </component>
      </template>
      ```

      Registration is not required if you pass the component itself to `is` rather than its name, e.g. in `<script setup>`.

      If `v-model` is used on a `<component>` tag, the template compiler will expand it to a `modelValue` prop and `update:modelValue` event listener, much like it would for any other component. However, this won't be compatible with native HTML elements, such as `<input>` or `<select>`. As a result, using `v-model` with a dynamically created native element won't work:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { ref } from 'vue'

      const tag = ref('input')
      const username = ref('')
      </script>

      <template>
        <!-- This won't work as 'input' is a native HTML element -->
        <component :is="tag" v-model="username" />
      </template>
      ```

      In practice, this edge case isn't common as native form fields are typically wrapped in components in real applications. If you do need to use a native element directly then you can split the `v-model` into an attribute and event manually.

    ## `<KeepAlive>`

    Caches dynamically toggled components wrapped inside.

    - **Props**

      ``` ts
      interface KeepAliveProps {
        /**
         * If specified, only components with names matched by
         * `include` will be cached.

         * not be cached.
         */
        exclude?: MatchPattern
        /**
         * The maximum number of component instances to cache.
         */
        max?: number | string
      }

      type MatchPattern = string | RegExp | (string | RegExp)[]
      ```

    - **Details**

      When wrapped around a dynamic component, `<KeepAlive>` caches the inactive component instances without destroying them.

      There can only be one active component instance as the direct child of `<KeepAlive>` at any time.

      When a component is toggled inside `<KeepAlive>`, its `activated` and `deactivated` lifecycle hooks will be invoked accordingly, providing an alternative to `mounted` and `unmounted`, which are not called. This applies to the direct child of `<KeepAlive>` as well as to all of its descendants.

    - **Example**

      Basic usage:

      ``` template
      <KeepAlive>
        <component :is="view"></component>
      </KeepAlive>
      ```

      When used with `v-if` / `v-else` branches, there must be only one component rendered at a time:

      ``` template
      <KeepAlive>
        <comp-a v-if="a > 1"></comp-a>
        <comp-b v-else></comp-b>
      </KeepAlive>
      ```

      Used together with `<Transition>`:

      ``` template
      <Transition>
        <KeepAlive>
          <component :is="view"></component>
        </KeepAlive>
      </Transition>
      ```

      Using `include` / `exclude`:

      ``` template
      <!-- comma-delimited string -->
      <KeepAlive include="a,b">
        <component :is="view"></component>
      </KeepAlive>

      <!-- regex (use `v-bind`) -->
      <KeepAlive :include="/a|b/">
        <component :is="view"></component>
      </KeepAlive>

      <!-- Array (use `v-bind`) -->
      <KeepAlive :include="['a', 'b']">
        <component :is="view"></component>
      </KeepAlive>
      ```

      Usage with `max`:

      ``` template
      <KeepAlive :max="10">
        <component :is="view"></component>
      </KeepAlive>
      ```

    ## `<slot>`

    Denotes slot content outlets in templates.

    - **Props**

      ``` ts
      interface SlotProps {
        /**
         * Any props passed to <slot> to passed as arguments

         * Reserved for specifying slot name.
         */
        name?: string
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The `<slot>` element can use the `name` attribute to specify a slot name. When no `name` is specified, it will render the default slot. Additional attributes passed to the slot element will be passed as slot props to the scoped slot defined in the parent.

      The element itself will be replaced by its matched slot content.

      `<slot>` elements in Vue templates are compiled into JavaScript, so they are not to be confused with [native `<slot>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot).

        moveClass?: string
      }
      ```

    - **Events**

      `<TransitionGroup>` emits the same events as `<Transition>`.

    - **Details**

      By default, `<TransitionGroup>` doesn't render a wrapper DOM element, but one can be defined via the `tag` prop.

      Note that every child in a `<transition-group>` must be [**uniquely keyed**](../guide/essentials/list#maintaining-state-with-key) for the animations to work properly.

      `<TransitionGroup>` supports moving transitions via CSS transform. When a child's position on screen has changed after an update, it will get applied a moving CSS class (auto generated from the `name` attribute or configured with the `move-class` prop). If the CSS `transform` property is "transition-able" when the moving class is applied, the element will be smoothly animated to its destination using the [FLIP technique](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/).

    - **Example**

      ``` template
      <TransitionGroup tag="ul" name="slide">
        <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">

    ## key

    The `key` special attribute is primarily used as a hint for Vue's virtual DOM algorithm to identify vnodes when diffing the new list of nodes against the old list.

    - **Expects:** `number | string | symbol`

    - **Details**

      Without keys, Vue uses an algorithm that minimizes element movement and tries to patch/reuse elements of the same type in-place as much as possible. With keys, it will reorder elements based on the order change of keys, and elements with keys that are no longer present will always be removed / destroyed.

      Children of the same common parent must have **unique keys**. Duplicate keys will cause render errors.

      The most common use case is combined with `v-for`:

      ``` template
      <ul>
        <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">...</li>
      </ul>
      ```

      It can also be used to force replacement of an element/component instead of reusing it. This can be useful when you want to:

      - Properly trigger lifecycle hooks of a component
      - Trigger transitions

      For example:

      ``` template
      <transition>
        <span :key="text">{{ text }}</span>
      </transition>
      ```

      When `text` changes, the `<span>` will always be replaced instead of patched, so a transition will be triggered.

  summary: Denotes a template ref

  description: |-
    ## ref

    Denotes a [template ref](../guide/essentials/template-refs).

    - **Expects:** `string | Function`

    - **Details**

      `ref` is used to register a reference to an element or a child component.

      In Options API, the reference will be registered under the component's `this.$refs` object:

      ``` template
      <!-- stored as this.$refs.p -->
      <p ref="p">hello</p>
      ```

      In Composition API, the reference will be stored in a ref with matching name:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { ref } from 'vue'

      const p = ref()
      </script>

      <template>
        <p ref="p">hello</p>
      </template>
      ```

      If used on a plain DOM element, the reference will be that element; if used on a child component, the reference will be the child component instance.

      Alternatively `ref` can accept a function value which provides full control over where to store the reference:

      ``` template
      <ChildComponent :ref="(el) => child = el" />
      ```

      An important note about the ref registration timing: because the refs themselves are created as a result of the render function, you must wait until the component is mounted before accessing them.

      `this.$refs` is also non-reactive, therefore you should not attempt to use it in templates for data-binding.

  summary: Dynamically bind one or more attributes, or a component prop to an expression
  belongs_to: Built-in Directives
  description: |-
    ## v-bind

    Dynamically bind one or more attributes, or a component prop to an expression.

    - **Shorthand:**

      - `:` or `.` (when using `.prop` modifier)
      - Omitting value (when attribute and bound value has the same name) ^(3.4+)

    - **Expects:** `any (with argument) | Object (without argument)`

    - **Argument:** `attrOrProp (optional)`

    - **Modifiers**

      - `.camel` - transform the kebab-case attribute name into camelCase.
      - `.prop` - force a binding to be set as a DOM property. ^(3.2+)
      - `.attr` - force a binding to be set as a DOM attribute. ^(3.2+)

    - **Usage**

      When used to bind the `class` or `style` attribute, `v-bind` supports additional value types such as Array or Objects. See linked guide section below for more details.

      When setting a binding on an element, Vue by default checks whether the element has the key defined as a property using an `in` operator check. If the property is defined, Vue will set the value as a DOM property instead of an attribute. This should work in most cases, but you can override this behavior by explicitly using `.prop` or `.attr` modifiers. This is sometimes necessary, especially when [working with custom elements](../guide/extras/web-components#passing-dom-properties).

      When used for component prop binding, the prop must be properly declared in the child component.

      When used without an argument, can be used to bind an object containing attribute name-value pairs.

    - **Example**

      ``` template
      <!-- bind an attribute -->

      <!-- prop binding. "prop" must be declared in the child component. -->
      <MyComponent :prop="someThing" />

      <!-- pass down parent props in common with a child component -->
      <MyComponent v-bind="$props" />

      <!-- XLink -->
      <svg><a :xlink:special="foo"></a></svg>
      ```

      The `.prop` modifier also has a dedicated shorthand, `.`:

      ``` template
      <div :someProperty.prop="someObject"></div>

      <!-- equivalent to -->
      <div .someProperty="someObject"></div>
      ```

      The `.camel` modifier allows camelizing a `v-bind` attribute name when using in-DOM templates, e.g. the SVG `viewBox` attribute:

      ``` template
      <svg :view-box.camel="viewBox"></svg>
      ```

      `.camel` is not needed if you are using string templates, or pre-compiling the template with a build step.

  description: |-
    ## v-for

    Render the element or template block multiple times based on the source data.

    - **Expects:** `Array | Object | number | string | Iterable`

    - **Details**

      The directive's value must use the special syntax `alias in expression` to provide an alias for the current element being iterated on:

      ``` template
      <div v-for="item in items">
        {{ item.text }}
      </div>
      ```

      Alternatively, you can also specify an alias for the index (or the key if used on an Object):

      ``` template
      <div v-for="(item, index) in items"></div>
      <div v-for="(value, key) in object"></div>
      <div v-for="(value, name, index) in object"></div>
      ```

      The default behavior of `v-for` will try to patch the elements in-place without moving them. To force it to reorder elements, you should provide an ordering hint with the `key` special attribute:

      ``` template
      <div v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">
        {{ item.text }}
      </div>
      ```

      `v-for` can also work on values that implement the [Iterable Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol), including native `Map` and `Set`.

    Update the element's [innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML).

    - **Expects:** `string`

    - **Details**

      Contents of `v-html` are inserted as plain HTML - Vue template syntax will not be processed. If you find yourself trying to compose templates using `v-html`, try to rethink the solution by using components instead.

      **Security Note**
      Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to [XSS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Only use `v-html` on trusted content and **never** on user-provided content.

      In [Single-File Components](../guide/scaling-up/sfc), `scoped` styles will not apply to content inside `v-html`, because that HTML is not processed by Vue's template compiler. If you want to target `v-html` content with scoped CSS, you can instead use [CSS modules](sfc-css-features#css-modules) or an additional, global `<style>` element with a manual scoping strategy such as BEM.

    - **Example**

      ``` template
      <div v-html="html"></div>

    ## v-if

    Conditionally render an element or a template fragment based on the truthy-ness of the expression value.

    - **Expects:** `any`

    - **Details**

      When a `v-if` element is toggled, the element and its contained directives / components are destroyed and re-constructed. If the initial condition is falsy, then the inner content won't be rendered at all.

      Can be used on `<template>` to denote a conditional block containing only text or multiple elements.

      This directive triggers transitions when its condition changes.

      When used together, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`. We don't recommend using these two directives together on one element — see the [list rendering guide](../guide/essentials/list#v-for-with-v-if) for details.

  summary: Memoize a sub-tree of the template
  belongs_to: Built-in Directives
  description: |-
    ## v-memo

    - **Expects:** `any[]`

    - **Details**

      Memoize a sub-tree of the template. Can be used on both elements and components. The directive expects a fixed-length array of dependency values to compare for the memoization. If every value in the array was the same as last render, then updates for the entire sub-tree will be skipped. For example:

      ``` template
      <div v-memo="[valueA, valueB]">
        ...
      </div>
      ```

      When the component re-renders, if both `valueA` and `valueB` remain the same, all updates for this `<div>` and its children will be skipped. In fact, even the Virtual DOM VNode creation will also be skipped since the memoized copy of the sub-tree can be reused.

      It is important to specify the memoization array correctly, otherwise we may skip updates that should indeed be applied. `v-memo` with an empty dependency array (`v-memo="[]"`) would be functionally equivalent to `v-once`.

      **Usage with `v-for`**

      `v-memo` is provided solely for micro optimizations in performance-critical scenarios and should be rarely needed. The most common case where this may prove helpful is when rendering large `v-for` lists (where `length > 1000`):

      ``` template
      <div v-for="item in list" :key="item.id" v-memo="[item.id === selected]">
        <p>ID: {{ item.id }} - selected: {{ item.id === selected }}</p>
        <p>...more child nodes</p>
      </div>
      ```

      When the component's `selected` state changes, a large amount of VNodes will be created even though most of the items remained exactly the same. The `v-memo` usage here is essentially saying "only update this item if it went from non-selected to selected, or the other way around". This allows every unaffected item to reuse its previous VNode and skip diffing entirely. Note we don't need to include `item.id` in the memo dependency array here since Vue automatically infers it from the item's `:key`.

      **WARNING**
      When using `v-memo` with `v-for`, make sure they are used on the same element. **`v-memo` does not work inside `v-for`.**

      `v-memo` can also be used on components to manually prevent unwanted updates in certain edge cases where the child component update check has been de-optimized. But again, it is the developer's responsibility to specify correct dependency arrays to avoid skipping necessary updates.

    Attach an event listener to the element.

    - **Shorthand:** `@`

    - **Expects:** `Function | Inline Statement | Object (without argument)`

    - **Argument:**`event` (optional if using Object syntax)

    - **Modifiers**

      - `.stop` - call `event.stopPropagation()`.
      - `.prevent` - call `event.preventDefault()`.
      - `.capture` - add event listener in capture mode.
      - `.self` - only trigger handler if event was dispatched from this element.
      - `.{keyAlias}` - only trigger handler on certain keys.
      - `.once` - trigger handler at most once.
      - `.left` - only trigger handler for left button mouse events.
      - `.right` - only trigger handler for right button mouse events.
      - `.middle` - only trigger handler for middle button mouse events.
      - `.passive` - attaches a DOM event with `{ passive: true }`.

    - **Details**

      The event type is denoted by the argument. The expression can be a method name, an inline statement, or omitted if there are modifiers present.

      When used on a normal element, it listens to [**native DOM events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) only. When used on a custom element component, it listens to **custom events** emitted on that child component.

      When listening to native DOM events, the method receives the native event as the only argument. If using inline statement, the statement has access to the special `$event` property: `v-on:click="handle('ok', $event)"`.

      `v-on` also supports binding to an object of event / listener pairs without an argument. Note when using the object syntax, it does not support any modifiers.

    - **Example**

      ``` template
      <!-- method handler -->
      <button v-on:click="doThis"></button>

      <!-- dynamic event -->
      <button v-on:[event]="doThis"></button>

      <!-- inline statement -->
      <button v-on:click="doThat('hello', $event)"></button>

      <!-- shorthand -->
      <button @click="doThis"></button>

      <!-- shorthand dynamic event -->
      <button @[event]="doThis"></button>

      <!-- stop propagation -->
      <button @click.stop="doThis"></button>

      <!-- prevent default -->
      <button @click.prevent="doThis"></button>

      <!-- prevent default without expression -->
      <form @submit.prevent></form>

      <!-- chain modifiers -->
      <button @click.stop.prevent="doThis"></button>

      <!-- key modifier using keyAlias -->
      <input @keyup.enter="onEnter" />

      <!-- the click event will be triggered at most once -->
      <button v-on:click.once="doThis"></button>

      <!-- object syntax -->
      <button v-on="{ mousedown: doThis, mouseup: doThat }"></button>
      ```

      Listening to custom events on a child component (the handler is called when "my-event" is emitted on the child):

      ``` template
      <MyComponent @my-event="handleThis" />

      <!-- inline statement -->
      <MyComponent @my-event="handleThis(123, $event)" />

    - **Does not expect expression**

    - **Details**

      On subsequent re-renders, the element/component and all its children will be treated as static content and skipped. This can be used to optimize update performance.

      ``` template
      <!-- single element -->
      <span v-once>This will never change: {{msg}}</span>
      <!-- the element have children -->

  summary: The first argument in the setup function is the props argument

  description: |-
    ## Accessing Props

    The first argument in the `setup` function is the `props` argument. Just as you would expect in a standard component, `props` inside of a `setup` function are reactive and will be updated when new props are passed in.

    ``` js
    export default {
      props: {
        title: String
      },
      setup(props) {
        console.log(props.title)
      }
    }
    ```

    Note that if you destructure the `props` object, the destructured variables will lose reactivity. It is therefore recommended to always access props in the form of `props.xxx`.

    If you really need to destructure the props, or need to pass a prop into an external function while retaining reactivity, you can do so with the [toRefs()](reactivity-utilities#torefs) and [toRef()](reactivity-utilities#toref) utility APIs:

    ``` js
    import { toRefs, toRef } from 'vue'

    export default {
      setup(props) {
        // turn `props` into an object of refs, then destructure
        const { title } = toRefs(props)
        // `title` is a ref that tracks `props.title`
        console.log(title.value)

        // OR, turn a single property on `props` into a ref
        const title = toRef(props, 'title')
      }
    }
    ```

  id: api/composition-api-setup#basic-usage
  summary: If you are using Composition API with Single-File Components, <script setup> is strongly recommended for a more succinct and ergonomic syntax
  belongs_to: 'Composition API: setup()'
  description: |-
    ## Basic Usage

    The `setup()` hook serves as the entry point for Composition API usage in components in the following cases:

    1.  Using Composition API without a build step;
    2.  Integrating with Composition-API-based code in an Options API component.

    **Note**

    If you are using Composition API with Single-File Components, [`<script setup>`](sfc-script-setup) is strongly recommended for a more succinct and ergonomic syntax.

    We can declare reactive state using [Reactivity APIs](reactivity-core) and expose them to the template by returning an object from `setup()`. The properties on the returned object will also be made available on the component instance (if other options are used):

    ``` javascript
    <script>
    import { ref } from 'vue'

    export default {
      setup() {
        const count = ref(0)

        // expose to template and other options API hooks
        return {
          count
        }
      },

      mounted() {
        console.log(this.count) // 0
      }
    }
    </script>

    <template>
      <button @click="count++">{{ count }}</button>
    </template>
    ```

    [refs](reactivity-core#ref) returned from `setup` are [automatically shallow unwrapped](../guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals#deep-reactivity) when accessed in the template so you do not need to use `.value` when accessing them. They are also unwrapped in the same way when accessed on `this`.

    `setup()` itself does not have access to the component instance - `this` will have a value of `undefined` inside `setup()`. You can access Composition-API-exposed values from Options API, but not the other way around.

    `setup()` should return an object *synchronously*. The only case when `async setup()` can be used is when the component is a descendant of a [Suspense](../guide/built-ins/suspense) component.

  description: |-
    ## computed()

    Takes a getter function and returns a readonly reactive [ref](#ref) object for the returned value from the getter. It can also take an object with `get` and `set` functions to create a writable ref object.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      // read-only
      function computed<T>(
        getter: (oldValue: T | undefined) => T,
        // see "Computed Debugging" link below
        debuggerOptions?: DebuggerOptions
      ): Readonly<Ref<Readonly<T>>>

      // writable
      function computed<T>(
        options: {
          get: (oldValue: T | undefined) => T
          set: (value: T) => void
        },
        debuggerOptions?: DebuggerOptions
      ): Ref<T>
      ```

    - **Example**

      Creating a readonly computed ref:

      ``` js
      const count = ref(1)
      const plusOne = computed(() => count.value + 1)

      console.log(plusOne.value) // 2

      plusOne.value++ // error
      ```

      Creating a writable computed ref:

      ``` js
      const count = ref(1)
      const plusOne = computed({
        get: () => count.value + 1,
        set: (val) => {
          count.value = val - 1
        }
      })

      plusOne.value = 1
      console.log(count.value) // 0
      ```

      Debugging:

      ``` js
      const plusOne = computed(() => count.value + 1, {
        onTrack(e) {
          debugger
        },
        onTrigger(e) {
          debugger
        }
      })
      ```

  summary: Creates a customized ref with explicit control over its dependency tracking and updates triggering
  belongs_to: 'Reactivity API: Advanced'
  description: |-
    ## customRef()

    Creates a customized ref with explicit control over its dependency tracking and updates triggering.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function customRef<T>(factory: CustomRefFactory<T>): Ref<T>

      type CustomRefFactory<T> = (
        track: () => void,
        trigger: () => void
      ) => {
        get: () => T
        set: (value: T) => void
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      `customRef()` expects a factory function, which receives `track` and `trigger` functions as arguments and should return an object with `get` and `set` methods.

      In general, `track()` should be called inside `get()`, and `trigger()` should be called inside `set()`. However, you have full control over when they should be called, or whether they should be called at all.

    - **Example**

      Creating a debounced ref that only updates the value after a certain timeout after the latest set call:

      ``` js
      import { customRef } from 'vue'

      export function useDebouncedRef(value, delay = 200) {
        let timeout
        return customRef((track, trigger) => {
          return {
            get() {
              track()
              return value
            },
            set(newValue) {
              clearTimeout(timeout)
              timeout = setTimeout(() => {
                value = newValue
                trigger()
              }, delay)
            }
          }
        })
      }
      ```

      Usage in component:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { useDebouncedRef } from './debouncedRef'
      const text = useDebouncedRef('hello')
      </script>

      <template>
        <input v-model="text" />
      </template>
      ```

In this case, `true` must be passed as the third argument to indicate that the function should be used as a factory instead of the value itself.\n\n  Similar to lifecycle hook registration APIs, `inject()` must be called synchronously during a component's `setup()` phase.\n\n  When using TypeScript, the key can be of type of `InjectionKey` - a Vue-provided utility type that extends `Symbol`, which can be used to sync the value type between `provide()` and `inject()`.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Assuming a parent component has provided values as shown in the previous `provide()` example:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { inject } from 'vue'\n  import { countSymbol } from './injectionSymbols'\n\n  // inject static value without default\n  const path = inject('path')\n\n  // inject reactive value\n  const count = inject('count')\n\n  // inject with Symbol keys\n  const count2 = inject(countSymbol)\n\n  // inject with default value\n  const bar = inject('path', '/default-path')\n\n  // inject with function default value\n  const fn = inject('function', () => {})\n\n  // inject with default value factory\n  const baz = inject('factory', () => new ExpensiveObject(), true)\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n## hasInjectionContext()\n\nReturns true if [inject()](#inject) can be used without warning about being called in the wrong place (e.g. outside of `setup()`).

For detailed use cases of this API, please consult its corresponding [RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0041-reactivity-effect-scope.md).

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function effectScope(detached?: boolean): EffectScope

      interface EffectScope {
        run<T>(fn: () => T): T | undefined // undefined if scope is inactive
        stop(): void
      }
      ```

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const scope = effectScope()

      scope.run(() => {
        const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)

        watch(doubled, () => console.log(doubled.value))

        watchEffect(() => console.log('Count: ', doubled.value))
      })

      // to dispose all effects in the scope
      scope.stop()
      ```

    ## inject()

    Injects a value provided by an ancestor component or the application (via `app.provide()`).

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      // without default value
      function inject<T>(key: InjectionKey<T> | string): T | undefined

      // with default value
      function inject<T>(key: InjectionKey<T> | string, defaultValue: T): T

      // with factory
      function inject<T>(
        key: InjectionKey<T> | string,
        defaultValue: () => T,
        treatDefaultAsFactory: true
      ): T
      ```

    - **Details**

      The first argument is the injection key. Vue will walk up the parent chain to locate a provided value with a matching key. If multiple components in the parent chain provides the same key, the one closest to the injecting component will "shadow" those higher up the chain. If no value with matching key was found, `inject()` returns `undefined` unless a default value is provided.

      The second argument is optional and is the default value to be used when no matching value was found.

      The second argument can also be a factory function that returns values that are expensive to create. In this case, `true` must be passed as the third argument to indicate that the function should be used as a factory instead of the value itself.

      Similar to lifecycle hook registration APIs, `inject()` must be called synchronously during a component's `setup()` phase.

      When using TypeScript, the key can be of type of `InjectionKey` - a Vue-provided utility type that extends `Symbol`, which can be used to sync the value type between `provide()` and `inject()`.

    - **Example**

      Assuming a parent component has provided values as shown in the previous `provide()` example:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { inject } from 'vue'
      import { countSymbol } from './injectionSymbols'

      // inject static value without default
      const path = inject('path')

      // inject reactive value
      const count = inject('count')

      // inject with Symbol keys
      const count2 = inject(countSymbol)

      // inject with default value
      const bar = inject('path', '/default-path')

      // inject with function default value
      const fn = inject('function', () => {})

      // inject with default value factory
      const baz = inject('factory', () => new ExpensiveObject(), true)
      </script>
      ```

  description: "# Composition API: Lifecycle Hooks\n\n**Usage Note**\n\nAll APIs listed on this page must be called synchronously during the `setup()` phase of a component. See [Guide - Lifecycle Hooks](../guide/essentials/lifecycle) for more details.\n\n## onMounted()\n\nRegisters a callback to be called after the component has been mounted.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function onMounted(callback: () => void): void\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  A component is considered mounted after:\n\n  - All of its synchronous child components have been mounted (does not include async components or components inside `<Suspense>` trees).\n\n  - Its own DOM tree has been created and inserted into the parent container. Note it only guarantees that the component's DOM tree is in-document if the application's root container is also in-document.\n\n  This hook is typically used for performing side effects that need access to the component's rendered DOM, or for limiting DOM-related code to the client in a [server-rendered application](../guide/scaling-up/ssr).\n\n  **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Accessing an element via template ref:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\n  const el = ref()\n\n  onMounted(() => {\n    el.value // <div>\n  })\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <div ref=\"el\"></div>\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n## onUpdated()\n\nRegisters a callback to be called after the component has updated its DOM tree due to a reactive state change.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function onUpdated(callback: () => void): void\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  A parent component's updated hook is called after that of its child components.\n\n  This hook is called after any DOM update of the component, which can be caused by different state changes, because multiple state changes can be batched into a single render cycle for performance reasons. If you need to access the updated DOM after a specific state change, use [nextTick()](general#nexttick) instead.\n\n  **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n  **WARNING**\n  Do not mutate component state in the updated hook - this will likely lead to an infinite update loop!\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Accessing updated DOM:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { ref, onUpdated } from 'vue'\n\n  const count = ref(0)\n\n  onUpdated(() => {\n    // text content should be the same as current `count.value`\n    console.log(document.getElementById('count').textContent)\n  })\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <button id=\"count\" @click=\"count++\">{{ count }}</button>\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n## onUnmounted()\n\nRegisters a callback to be called after the component has been unmounted.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function onUnmounted(callback: () => void): void\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  A component is considered unmounted after:\n\n  - All of its child components have been unmounted.\n\n  - All of its associated reactive effects (render effect and computed / watchers created during `setup()`) have been stopped.\n\n  Use this hook to clean up manually created side effects such as timers, DOM event listeners or server connections.\n\n  **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'\n\n  let intervalId\n  onMounted(() => {\n    intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n      // ...\n    })\n  })\n\n  onUnmounted(() => clearInterval(intervalId))\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n## onBeforeMount()\n\nRegisters a hook to be called right before the component is to be mounted.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function onBeforeMount(callback: () => void): void\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  When this hook is called, the component has finished setting up its reactive state, but no DOM nodes have been created yet.

    ## markRaw()

    Marks an object so that it will never be converted to a proxy. Returns the object itself.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function markRaw<T extends object>(value: T): T
      ```

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const foo = markRaw({})
      console.log(isReactive(reactive(foo))) // false

      // also works when nested inside other reactive objects
      const bar = reactive({ foo })
      console.log(isReactive(bar.foo)) // false
      ```

      **Use with Caution**
      `markRaw()` and shallow APIs such as `shallowReactive()` allow you to selectively opt-out of the default deep reactive/readonly conversion and embed raw, non-proxied objects in your state graph. They can be used for various reasons:

      - Some values simply should not be made reactive, for example a complex 3rd party class instance, or a Vue component object.

      - Skipping proxy conversion can provide performance improvements when rendering large lists with immutable data sources.

      They are considered advanced because the raw opt-out is only at the root level, so if you set a nested, non-marked raw object into a reactive object and then access it again, you get the proxied version back. This can lead to **identity hazards** - i.e. performing an operation that relies on object identity but using both the raw and the proxied version of the same object:

      ``` js
      const foo = markRaw({
        nested: {}
      })

      const bar = reactive({
        // although `foo` is marked as raw, foo.nested is not.
        nested: foo.nested
      })

      console.log(foo.nested === bar.nested) // false
      ```

      Identity hazards are in general rare. However, to properly utilize these APIs while safely avoiding identity hazards requires a solid understanding of how the reactivity system works.

    ## onMounted()

    Registers a callback to be called after the component has been mounted.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function onMounted(callback: () => void): void
      ```

    - **Details**

      A component is considered mounted after:

      - All of its synchronous child components have been mounted (does not include async components or components inside `<Suspense>` trees).

      - Its own DOM tree has been created and inserted into the parent container. Note it only guarantees that the component's DOM tree is in-document if the application's root container is also in-document.

      This hook is typically used for performing side effects that need access to the component's rendered DOM, or for limiting DOM-related code to the client in a [server-rendered application](../guide/scaling-up/ssr).

      **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**

    - **Example**

      Accessing an element via template ref:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

      const el = ref()

      onMounted(() => {
        el.value // <div>
      })
      </script>

      <template>
        <div ref="el"></div>
      </template>

    Registers a callback to be called after the component has been unmounted.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function onUnmounted(callback: () => void): void
      ```

    - **Details**

      A component is considered unmounted after:

      - All of its child components have been unmounted.

      - All of its associated reactive effects (render effect and computed / watchers created during `setup()`) have been stopped.

      Use this hook to clean up manually created side effects such as timers, DOM event listeners or server connections.

      **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**

    - **Example**

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

      let intervalId
      onMounted(() => {
        intervalId = setInterval(() => {

    ## onUpdated()

    Registers a callback to be called after the component has updated its DOM tree due to a reactive state change.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function onUpdated(callback: () => void): void
      ```

    - **Details**

      A parent component's updated hook is called after that of its child components.

      This hook is called after any DOM update of the component, which can be caused by different state changes, because multiple state changes can be batched into a single render cycle for performance reasons. If you need to access the updated DOM after a specific state change, use [nextTick()](general#nexttick) instead.

      **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**

      **WARNING**
      Do not mutate component state in the updated hook - this will likely lead to an infinite update loop!

    - **Example**

      Accessing updated DOM:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { ref, onUpdated } from 'vue'

      const count = ref(0)

      onUpdated(() => {
        // text content should be the same as current `count.value`
        console.log(document.getElementById('count').textContent)
      })
      </script>

      <template>
        <button id="count" @click="count++">{{ count }}</button>

    ## provide()

    Provides a value that can be injected by descendant components.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function provide<T>(key: InjectionKey<T> | string, value: T): void
      ```

    - **Details**

      `provide()` takes two arguments: the key, which can be a string or a symbol, and the value to be injected.

      When using TypeScript, the key can be a symbol casted as `InjectionKey` - a Vue provided utility type that extends `Symbol`, which can be used to sync the value type between `provide()` and `inject()`.

      Similar to lifecycle hook registration APIs, `provide()` must be called synchronously during a component's `setup()` phase.

    - **Example**

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { ref, provide } from 'vue'
      import { countSymbol } from './injectionSymbols'

      // provide static value
      provide('path', '/project/')

      // provide reactive value
      const count = ref(0)
      provide('count', count)

      // provide with Symbol keys
      provide(countSymbol, count)

  summary: Returns a reactive proxy of the object

    ## reactive()

    Returns a reactive proxy of the object.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function reactive<T extends object>(target: T): UnwrapNestedRefs<T>
      ```

    - **Details**

      The reactive conversion is "deep": it affects all nested properties. A reactive object also deeply unwraps any properties that are [refs](#ref) while maintaining reactivity.

      It should also be noted that there is no ref unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`.

      To avoid the deep conversion and only retain reactivity at the root level, use [shallowReactive()](reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) instead.

      The returned object and its nested objects are wrapped with [ES Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and **not** equal to the original objects. It is recommended to work exclusively with the reactive proxy and avoid relying on the original object.

    - **Example**

      Creating a reactive object:

      ``` js
      const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })
      obj.count++
      ```

      Ref unwrapping:

      ``` ts
      const count = ref(1)
      const obj = reactive({ count })

      // ref will be unwrapped
      console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true

      // it will update `obj.count`
      count.value++
      console.log(count.value) // 2
      console.log(obj.count) // 2

      // it will also update `count` ref
      obj.count++
      console.log(obj.count) // 3
      console.log(count.value) // 3
      ```

      Note that refs are **not** unwrapped when accessed as array or collection elements:

      ``` js
      const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])
      // need .value here
      console.log(books[0].value)

      const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))
      // need .value here
      console.log(map.get('count').value)
      ```

      When assigning a [ref](#ref) to a `reactive` property, that ref will also be automatically unwrapped:

      ``` ts
      const count = ref(1)
      const obj = reactive({})

      obj.count = count

      console.log(obj.count) // 1
      console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true
      ```

    ## readonly()

    Takes an object (reactive or plain) or a [ref](#ref) and returns a readonly proxy to the original.

    - **Type**

      function readonly<T extends object>(
        target: T
      ): DeepReadonly<UnwrapNestedRefs<T>>
      ```

    - **Details**

      A readonly proxy is deep: any nested property accessed will be readonly as well. It also has the same ref-unwrapping behavior as `reactive()`, except the unwrapped values will also be made readonly.

      To avoid the deep conversion, use [shallowReadonly()](reactivity-advanced#shallowreadonly) instead.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const original = reactive({ count: 0 })

      const copy = readonly(original)

      watchEffect(() => {
        // works for reactivity tracking
        console.log(copy.count)
      })

      // mutating original will trigger watchers relying on the copy
      original.count++

      // mutating the copy will fail and result in a warning
      copy.count++ // warning!

    ## ref()

    Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property `.value` that points to the inner value.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function ref<T>(value: T): Ref<UnwrapRef<T>>

      interface Ref<T> {
        value: T
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The ref object is mutable - i.e. you can assign new values to `.value`. It is also reactive - i.e. any read operations to `.value` are tracked, and write operations will trigger associated effects.

      If an object is assigned as a ref's value, the object is made deeply reactive with [reactive()](#reactive). This also means if the object contains nested refs, they will be deeply unwrapped.

      To avoid the deep conversion, use [`shallowRef()`](reactivity-advanced#shallowref) instead.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const count = ref(0)
      console.log(count.value) // 0

      count.value = 1
      console.log(count.value) // 1

  summary: The second argument passed to the setup function is a Setup Context object
  belongs_to: 'Composition API: setup()'
  description: |-
    ## Setup Context

    The second argument passed to the `setup` function is a **Setup Context** object. The context object exposes other values that may be useful inside `setup`:

    ``` js
    export default {
      setup(props, context) {
        // Attributes (Non-reactive object, equivalent to $attrs)
        console.log(context.attrs)

        // Slots (Non-reactive object, equivalent to $slots)
        console.log(context.slots)

        // Emit events (Function, equivalent to $emit)
        console.log(context.emit)

        // Expose public properties (Function)
        console.log(context.expose)
      }
    }
    ```

    The context object is not reactive and can be safely destructured:

    ``` js
    export default {
      setup(props, { attrs, slots, emit, expose }) {
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

    `attrs` and `slots` are stateful objects that are always updated when the component itself is updated. This means you should avoid destructuring them and always reference properties as `attrs.x` or `slots.x`. Also note that, unlike `props`, the properties of `attrs` and `slots` are **not** reactive. If you intend to apply side effects based on changes to `attrs` or `slots`, you should do so inside an `onBeforeUpdate` lifecycle hook.

    ### Exposing Public Properties

    `expose` is a function that can be used to explicitly limit the properties exposed when the component instance is accessed by a parent component via [template refs](../guide/essentials/template-refs#ref-on-component):

    ``` js
    export default {
      setup(props, { expose }) {
        // make the instance "closed" -
        // i.e. do not expose anything to the parent
        expose()

        const publicCount = ref(0)
        const privateCount = ref(0)
        // selectively expose local state
        expose({ count: publicCount })
      }
    }
    ```

  id: api/composition-api-setup
  summary: If you are using Composition API with Single-File Components, <script setup> is strongly recommended for a more succinct and ergonomic syntax
  description: "# Composition API: setup()\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nThe `setup()` hook serves as the entry point for Composition API usage in components in the following cases:\n\n1.  Using Composition API without a build step;\n2.  Integrating with Composition-API-based code in an Options API component.\n\n**Note**\n\nIf you are using Composition API with Single-File Components, [`<script setup>`](sfc-script-setup) is strongly recommended for a more succinct and ergonomic syntax.\n\nWe can declare reactive state using [Reactivity APIs](reactivity-core) and expose them to the template by returning an object from `setup()`. The properties on the returned object will also be made available on the component instance (if other options are used):\n\n``` javascript\n<script>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n\n    // expose to template and other options API hooks\n    return {\n      count\n    }\n  },\n\n  mounted() {\n    console.log(this.count) // 0\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"count++\">{{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\n[refs](reactivity-core#ref) returned from `setup` are [automatically shallow unwrapped](../guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals#deep-reactivity) when accessed in the template so you do not need to use `.value` when accessing them. They are also unwrapped in the same way when accessed on `this`.\n\n`setup()` itself does not have access to the component instance - `this` will have a value of `undefined` inside `setup()`. You can access Composition-API-exposed values from Options API, but not the other way around.\n\n`setup()` should return an object *synchronously*. The only case when `async setup()` can be used is when the component is a descendant of a [Suspense](../guide/built-ins/suspense) component.\n\n## Accessing Props\n\nThe first argument in the `setup` function is the `props` argument. Just as you would expect in a standard component, `props` inside of a `setup` function are reactive and will be updated when new props are passed in.\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    title: String\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    console.log(props.title)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that if you destructure the `props` object, the destructured variables will lose reactivity. It is therefore recommended to always access props in the form of `props.xxx`.\n\nIf you really need to destructure the props, or need to pass a prop into an external function while retaining reactivity, you can do so with the [toRefs()](reactivity-utilities#torefs) and [toRef()](reactivity-utilities#toref) utility APIs:\n\n``` js\nimport { toRefs, toRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup(props) {\n    // turn `props` into an object of refs, then destructure\n    const { title } = toRefs(props)\n    // `title` is a ref that tracks `props.title`\n    console.log(title.value)\n\n    // OR, turn a single property on `props` into a ref\n    const title = toRef(props, 'title')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Setup Context\n\nThe second argument passed to the `setup` function is a **Setup Context** object. The context object exposes other values that may be useful inside `setup`:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  setup(props, context) {\n    // Attributes (Non-reactive object, equivalent to $attrs)\n    console.log(context.attrs)\n\n    // Slots (Non-reactive object, equivalent to $slots)\n    console.log(context.slots)\n\n    // Emit events (Function, equivalent to $emit)\n    console.log(context.emit)\n\n    // Expose public properties (Function)\n    console.log(context.expose)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe context object is not reactive and can be safely destructured:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  setup(props, { attrs, slots, emit, expose }) {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`attrs` and `slots` are stateful objects that are always updated when the component itself is updated. This means you should avoid destructuring them and always reference properties as `attrs.x` or `slots.x`. Also note that, unlike `props`, the properties of `attrs` and `slots` are **not** reactive. If you intend to apply side effects based on changes to `attrs` or `slots`, you should do so inside an `onBeforeUpdate` lifecycle hook.\n\n### Exposing Public Properties\n\n`expose` is a function that can be used to explicitly limit the properties exposed when the component instance is accessed by a parent component via [template refs](../guide/essentials/template-refs#ref-on-component):\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  setup(props, { expose }) {\n    // make the instance \"closed\" -\n    // i.e. do not expose anything to the parent\n    expose()\n\n    const publicCount = ref(0)\n    const privateCount = ref(0)\n    // selectively expose local state\n    expose({ count: publicCount })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage with Render Functions\n\n`setup` can also return a [render function](../guide/extras/render-function) which can directly make use of the reactive state declared in the same scope:\n\n``` js\nimport { h, ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n    return () => h('div', count.value)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReturning a render function prevents us from returning anything else. Internally that shouldn't be a problem, but it can be problematic if we want to expose methods of this component to the parent component via template refs.\n\nWe can solve this problem by calling [`expose()`](#exposing-public-properties):\n\n``` js\nimport { h, ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup(props, { expose }) {\n    const count = ref(0)\n    const increment = () => ++count.value\n\n    expose({\n      increment\n    })\n\n    return () => h('div', count.value)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `increment` method would then be available in the parent component via a template ref.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup)"

    ## shallowReactive()

    Shallow version of [`reactive()`](reactivity-core#reactive).

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function shallowReactive<T extends object>(target: T): T
      ```

    - **Details**

      Unlike `reactive()`, there is no deep conversion: only root-level properties are reactive for a shallow reactive object. Property values are stored and exposed as-is - this also means properties with ref values will **not** be automatically unwrapped.

      **Use with Caution**
      Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component. Avoid nesting it inside a deep reactive object as it creates a tree with inconsistent reactivity behavior which can be difficult to understand and debug.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const state = shallowReactive({
        foo: 1,
        nested: {
          bar: 2
        }
      })

    ## shallowReadonly()

    Shallow version of [`readonly()`](reactivity-core#readonly).

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function shallowReadonly<T extends object>(target: T): Readonly<T>
      ```

    - **Details**

      Unlike `readonly()`, there is no deep conversion: only root-level properties are made readonly. Property values are stored and exposed as-is - this also means properties with ref values will **not** be automatically unwrapped.

      **Use with Caution**
      Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component. Avoid nesting it inside a deep reactive object as it creates a tree with inconsistent reactivity behavior which can be difficult to understand and debug.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const state = shallowReadonly({
        foo: 1,
        nested: {
          bar: 2
        }
      })

      // mutating state's own properties will fail
      state.foo++

      // ...but works on nested objects
      isReadonly(state.nested) // false

      // works
      state.nested.bar++
      ```

    ## shallowRef()

    Shallow version of [`ref()`](reactivity-core#ref).

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function shallowRef<T>(value: T): ShallowRef<T>

      interface ShallowRef<T> {
        value: T
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      Unlike `ref()`, the inner value of a shallow ref is stored and exposed as-is, and will not be made deeply reactive. Only the `.value` access is reactive.

      `shallowRef()` is typically used for performance optimizations of large data structures, or integration with external state management systems.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const state = shallowRef({ count: 1 })

      // does NOT trigger change
      state.value.count = 2

      // does trigger change
      state.value = { count: 2 }
      ```

    ## toRaw()

    Returns the raw, original object of a Vue-created proxy.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function toRaw<T>(proxy: T): T
      ```

    - **Details**

      `toRaw()` can return the original object from proxies created by [`reactive()`](reactivity-core#reactive), [`readonly()`](reactivity-core#readonly), [`shallowReactive()`](#shallowreactive) or [`shallowReadonly()`](#shallowreadonly).

      This is an escape hatch that can be used to temporarily read without incurring proxy access / tracking overhead or write without triggering changes. It is **not** recommended to hold a persistent reference to the original object. Use with caution.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const foo = {}
      const reactiveFoo = reactive(foo)

      console.log(toRaw(reactiveFoo) === foo) // true
      ```

  summary: Can be used to normalize values / refs / getters into refs (3.3+)

  description: |-
    ## toRef()

    Can be used to normalize values / refs / getters into refs (3.3+).

    Can also be used to create a ref for a property on a source reactive object. The created ref is synced with its source property: mutating the source property will update the ref, and vice-versa.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      // normalization signature (3.3+)
      function toRef<T>(
        value: T
      ): T extends () => infer R
        ? Readonly<Ref<R>>
        : T extends Ref
        ? T
        : Ref<UnwrapRef<T>>

      // object property signature
      function toRef<T extends object, K extends keyof T>(
        object: T,
        key: K,
        defaultValue?: T[K]
      ): ToRef<T[K]>

      type ToRef<T> = T extends Ref ? T : Ref<T>
      ```

    - **Example**

      Normalization signature (3.3+):

      ``` js
      // returns existing refs as-is
      toRef(existingRef)

      // creates a readonly ref that calls the getter on .value access
      toRef(() => props.foo)

      // creates normal refs from non-function values
      // equivalent to ref(1)
      toRef(1)
      ```

      Object property signature:

      ``` js
      const state = reactive({
        foo: 1,
        bar: 2
      })

      // a two-way ref that syncs with the original property
      const fooRef = toRef(state, 'foo')

      // mutating the ref updates the original
      fooRef.value++
      console.log(state.foo) // 2

      // mutating the original also updates the ref
      state.foo++
      console.log(fooRef.value) // 3
      ```

      Note this is different from:

      ``` js
      const fooRef = ref(state.foo)
      ```

      The above ref is **not** synced with `state.foo`, because the `ref()` receives a plain number value.

      `toRef()` is useful when you want to pass the ref of a prop to a composable function:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      import { toRef } from 'vue'

      const props = defineProps(/* ... */)

      // convert `props.foo` into a ref, then pass into
      // a composable
      useSomeFeature(toRef(props, 'foo'))

      // getter syntax - recommended in 3.3+
      useSomeFeature(toRef(() => props.foo))
      </script>
      ```

      When `toRef` is used with component props, the usual restrictions around mutating the props still apply. Attempting to assign a new value to the ref is equivalent to trying to modify the prop directly and is not allowed. In that scenario you may want to consider using [`computed`](reactivity-core#computed) with `get` and `set` instead. See the guide to [using `v-model` with components](../guide/components/v-model) for more information.

      When using the object property signature, `toRef()` will return a usable ref even if the source property doesn't currently exist. This makes it possible to work with optional properties, which wouldn't be picked up by [`toRefs`](#torefs).

    ## toRefs()

    Converts a reactive object to a plain object where each property of the resulting object is a ref pointing to the corresponding property of the original object. Each individual ref is created using [`toRef()`](#toref).

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function toRefs<T extends object>(
        object: T
      ): {
        [K in keyof T]: ToRef<T[K]>
      }

      type ToRef = T extends Ref ? T : Ref<T>
      ```

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const state = reactive({
        foo: 1,
        bar: 2
      })

      const stateAsRefs = toRefs(state)
      /*
      Type of stateAsRefs: {
        foo: Ref<number>,
        bar: Ref<number>
      }
      */

      // The ref and the original property is "linked"
      state.foo++
      console.log(stateAsRefs.foo.value) // 2

      stateAsRefs.foo.value++
      console.log(state.foo) // 3
      ```

      `toRefs` is useful when returning a reactive object from a composable function so that the consuming component can destructure/spread the returned object without losing reactivity:

      ``` js
      function useFeatureX() {
        const state = reactive({
          foo: 1,
          bar: 2
        })

        // ...logic operating on state

        // convert to refs when returning
        return toRefs(state)
      }

      // can destructure without losing reactivity
      const { foo, bar } = useFeatureX()
      ```

      `toRefs` will only generate refs for properties that are enumerable on the source object at call time. To create a ref for a property that may not exist yet, use [`toRef`](#toref) instead.

  description: |-
    ## toValue()

    Normalizes values / refs / getters to values. This is similar to [unref()](#unref), except that it also normalizes getters. If the argument is a getter, it will be invoked and its return value will be returned.

    This can be used in [Composables](../guide/reusability/composables) to normalize an argument that can be either a value, a ref, or a getter.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function toValue<T>(source: T | Ref<T> | (() => T)): T
      ```

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      toValue(1) //       --> 1
      toValue(ref(1)) //  --> 1
      toValue(() => 1) // --> 1
      ```

      Normalizing arguments in composables:

      ``` ts
      import type { MaybeRefOrGetter } from 'vue'

      function useFeature(id: MaybeRefOrGetter<number>) {
        watch(() => toValue(id), id => {
          // react to id changes
        })
      }

      // this composable supports any of the following:
      useFeature(1)
      useFeature(ref(1))
      useFeature(() => 1)

The source can be one of the following:\n\n  - A getter function that returns a value\n  - A ref\n  - A reactive object\n  - ...or an array of the above.\n\n  The second argument is the callback that will be called when the source changes. The callback receives three arguments: the new value, the old value, and a function for registering a side effect cleanup callback. The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request.\n\n  When watching multiple sources, the callback receives two arrays containing new / old values corresponding to the source array.\n\n  The third optional argument is an options object that supports the following options:\n\n  - **`immediate`**: trigger the callback immediately on watcher creation. Old value will be `undefined` on the first call.\n  - **`deep`**: force deep traversal of the source if it is an object, so that the callback fires on deep mutations. See [Deep Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers#deep-watchers).\n  - **`flush`**: adjust the callback's flush timing. See [Callback Flush Timing](../guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) and [`watchEffect()`](reactivity-core#watcheffect).\n  - **`onTrack / onTrigger`**: debug the watcher's dependencies. See [Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging).\n  - **`once`**: run the callback only once. The watcher is automatically stopped after the first callback run.\n\n  Compared to [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect), `watch()` allows us to:\n\n  - Perform the side effect lazily;\n  - Be more specific about what state should trigger the watcher to re-run;\n  - Access both the previous and current value of the watched state.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Watching a getter:\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n  watch(\n    () => state.count,\n    (count, prevCount) => {\n      /* ... */\n    }\n  )\n  ```\n\n  Watching a ref:\n\n  ``` js\n  const count = ref(0)\n  watch(count, (count, prevCount) => {\n    /* ... */\n  })\n  ```\n\n  When watching multiple sources, the callback receives arrays containing new / old values corresponding to the source array:\n\n  ``` js\n  watch([fooRef, barRef], ([foo, bar], [prevFoo, prevBar]) => {\n    /* ... */\n  })\n  ```\n\n  When using a getter source, the watcher only fires if the getter's return value has changed. If you want the callback to fire even on deep mutations, you need to explicitly force the watcher into deep mode with `{ deep: true }`. Note in deep mode, the new value and the old will be the same object if the callback was triggered by a deep mutation:\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n  watch(\n    () => state,\n    (newValue, oldValue) => {\n      // newValue === oldValue\n    },\n    { deep: true }\n  )\n  ```\n\n  When directly watching a reactive object, the watcher is automatically in deep mode:\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n  watch(state, () => {\n    /* triggers on deep mutation to state */\n  })\n  ```\n\n  `watch()` shares the same flush timing and debugging options with [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect):\n\n  ``` js\n  watch(source, callback, {\n    flush: 'post',\n    onTrack(e) {\n      debugger\n    },\n    onTrigger(e) {\n      debugger\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  Stopping the watcher:\n\n  ``` js\n  const stop = watch(source, callback)\n\n  // when the watcher is no longer needed:\n  stop()\n  ```\n\n  Side effect cleanup:\n\n  ``` js\n  watch(id, async (newId, oldId, onCleanup) => {\n    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(newId)\n    // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes, cancelling\n    // the previous request if it hasn't completed yet\n    onCleanup(cancel)\n    data.value = await response\n  })\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers)\n  - [Guide - Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core)"

    ## watchEffect()

    Runs a function immediately while reactively tracking its dependencies and re-runs it whenever the dependencies are changed.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      function watchEffect(
        effect: (onCleanup: OnCleanup) => void,
        options?: WatchEffectOptions
      ): StopHandle

      type OnCleanup = (cleanupFn: () => void) => void

      interface WatchEffectOptions {
        flush?: 'pre' | 'post' | 'sync' // default: 'pre'
        onTrack?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
        onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
      }

      type StopHandle = () => void
      ```

    - **Details**

      The first argument is the effect function to be run. The effect function receives a function that can be used to register a cleanup callback. The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request (see example below).

      The second argument is an optional options object that can be used to adjust the effect's flush timing or to debug the effect's dependencies.

      By default, watchers will run just prior to component rendering. Setting `flush: 'post'` will defer the watcher until after component rendering. See [Callback Flush Timing](../guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) for more information. In rare cases, it might be necessary to trigger a watcher immediately when a reactive dependency changes, e.g. to invalidate a cache. This can be achieved using `flush: 'sync'`. However, this setting should be used with caution, as it can lead to problems with performance and data consistency if multiple properties are being updated at the same time.

      The return value is a handle function that can be called to stop the effect from running again.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const count = ref(0)

      watchEffect(() => console.log(count.value))
      // -> logs 0

      count.value++
      // -> logs 1
      ```

      Side effect cleanup:

      ``` js
      watchEffect(async (onCleanup) => {
        const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(id.value)
        // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes
        // so that previous pending request will be cancelled
        // if not yet completed
        onCleanup(cancel)
        data.value = await response
      })
      ```

      Stopping the watcher:

      ``` js
      const stop = watchEffect(() => {})

      // when the watcher is no longer needed:
      stop()
      ```

      Options:

      ``` js
      watchEffect(() => {}, {
        flush: 'post',
        onTrack(e) {
          debugger
        },
        onTrigger(e) {
          debugger
        }
      })
      ```

    ## app.component()

    Registers a global component if passing both a name string and a component definition, or retrieves an already registered one if only the name is passed.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface App {
        component(name: string): Component | undefined
        component(name: string, component: Component): this
      }
      ```

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      import { createApp } from 'vue'

      const app = createApp({})

      // register an options object
      app.component('my-component', {
        /* ... */
      })

      // retrieve a registered component
      const MyComponent = app.component('my-component')
      ```

    ## app.config

    Every application instance exposes a `config` object that contains the configuration settings for that application. You can modify its properties (documented below) before mounting your application.

    ``` js
    import { createApp } from 'vue'

    const app = createApp(/* ... */)

    console.log(app.config)
    ```
- name: 'Global API: app.config.compilerOptions'
  id: api/application#app-config-compileroptions
  summary: Configure runtime compiler options
  belongs_to: Application API
  description: |-
    ## app.config.compilerOptions

    Configure runtime compiler options. Values set on this object will be passed to the in-browser template compiler and affect every component in the configured app. Note you can also override these options on a per-component basis using the [`compilerOptions` option](options-rendering#compileroptions).

    **Important**

    This config option is only respected when using the full build (i.e. the standalone `vue.js` that can compile templates in the browser). If you are using the runtime-only build with a build setup, compiler options must be passed to `@vue/compiler-dom` via build tool configurations instead.

    - For `vue-loader`: [pass via the `compilerOptions` loader option](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/options.html#compileroptions). Also see [how to configure it in `vue-cli`](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html#modifying-options-of-a-loader).

    - For `vite`: [pass via `@vitejs/plugin-vue` options](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#options).

    ### app.config.compilerOptions.isCustomElement

    Specifies a check method to recognize native custom elements.

    - **Type:** `(tag: string) => boolean`

    - **Details**

      Should return `true` if the tag should be treated as a native custom element. For a matched tag, Vue will render it as a native element instead of attempting to resolve it as a Vue component.

      Native HTML and SVG tags don't need to be matched in this function - Vue's parser recognizes them automatically.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      // treat all tags starting with 'ion-' as custom elements
      app.config.compilerOptions.isCustomElement = (tag) => {
        return tag.startsWith('ion-')
      }
      ```

    - **See also** [Vue and Web Components](../guide/extras/web-components)

    ### app.config.compilerOptions.whitespace

    Adjusts template whitespace handling behavior.

    - **Type:** `'condense' | 'preserve'`

    - **Default:** `'condense'`

    - **Details**

      Vue removes / condenses whitespace characters in templates to produce more efficient compiled output. The default strategy is "condense", with the following behavior:

      1.  Leading / ending whitespace characters inside an element are condensed into a single space.
      2.  Whitespace characters between elements that contain newlines are removed.
      3.  Consecutive whitespace characters in text nodes are condensed into a single space.

      Setting this option to `'preserve'` will disable (2) and (3).

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      app.config.compilerOptions.whitespace = 'preserve'
      ```

    ### app.config.compilerOptions.delimiters

    Adjusts the delimiters used for text interpolation within the template.

    - **Type:** `[string, string]`

    - **Default:** `['{{', '}}']`

    - **Details**

      This is typically used to avoid conflicting with server-side frameworks that also use mustache syntax.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      // Delimiters changed to ES6 template string style
      app.config.compilerOptions.delimiters = ['${', '}']
      ```

    ### app.config.compilerOptions.comments

    Adjusts treatment of HTML comments in templates.

    - **Type:** `boolean`

    - **Default:** `false`

    - **Details**

      By default, Vue will remove the comments in production. Setting this option to `true` will force Vue to preserve comments even in production. Comments are always preserved during development. This option is typically used when Vue is used with other libraries that rely on HTML comments.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      app.config.compilerOptions.comments = true
      ```

    ## app.config.errorHandler

    Assign a global handler for uncaught errors propagating from within the application.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface AppConfig {
        errorHandler?: (
          err: unknown,
          instance: ComponentPublicInstance | null,
          // `info` is a Vue-specific error info,
          // e.g. which lifecycle hook the error was thrown in
          info: string
        ) => void
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The error handler receives three arguments: the error, the component instance that triggered the error, and an information string specifying the error source type.

      It can capture errors from the following sources:

      - Component renders
      - Event handlers
      - Lifecycle hooks
      - `setup()` function
      - Watchers
      - Custom directive hooks
      - Transition hooks

      **TIP**
      In production, the 3rd argument (`info`) will be a shortened code instead of the full information string. You can find the code to string mapping in the [Production Error Code Reference](https://vuejs.org/error-reference/#runtime-errors).

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      app.config.errorHandler = (err, instance, info) => {
        // handle error, e.g. report to a service
      }
      ```

  description: |-
    ## app.config.globalProperties

    An object that can be used to register global properties that can be accessed on any component instance inside the application.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface AppConfig {
        globalProperties: Record<string, any>
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      This is a replacement of Vue 2's `Vue.prototype` which is no longer present in Vue 3. As with anything global, this should be used sparingly.

      If a global property conflicts with a component’s own property, the component's own property will have higher priority.

    - **Usage**

      ``` js
      app.config.globalProperties.msg = 'hello'
      ```

      This makes `msg` available inside any component template in the application, and also on `this` of any component instance:

      ``` js
      export default {
        mounted() {
          console.log(this.msg) // 'hello'
        }
      }
      ```

    ## app.config.warnHandler

    Assign a custom handler for runtime warnings from Vue.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface AppConfig {

          msg: string,

          trace: string
        ) => void
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The warning handler receives the warning message as the first argument, the source component instance as the second argument, and a component trace string as the third.

      It can be used to filter out specific warnings to reduce console verbosity. All Vue warnings should be addressed during development, so this is only recommended during debug sessions to focus on specific warnings among many, and should be removed once the debugging is done.

      **TIP**
      Warnings only work during development, so this config is ignored in production mode.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      app.config.warnHandler = (msg, instance, trace) => {
        // `trace` is the component hierarchy trace
      }

  description: |-
    ## app.mixin()

    Applies a global mixin (scoped to the application). A global mixin applies its included options to every component instance in the application.

    **Not Recommended**

    Mixins are supported in Vue 3 mainly for backwards compatibility, due to their widespread use in ecosystem libraries. Use of mixins, especially global mixins, should be avoided in application code.

    For logic reuse, prefer [Composables](../guide/reusability/composables) instead.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface App {
        mount(rootContainer: Element | string): ComponentPublicInstance
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The argument can either be an actual DOM element or a CSS selector (the first matched element will be used). Returns the root component instance.

      If the component has a template or a render function defined, it will replace any existing DOM nodes inside the container. Otherwise, if the runtime compiler is available, the `innerHTML` of the container will be used as the template.

      In SSR hydration mode, it will hydrate the existing DOM nodes inside the container. If there are [mismatches](../guide/scaling-up/ssr#hydration-mismatch), the existing DOM nodes will be morphed to match the expected output.

      For each app instance, `mount()` can only be called once.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      import { createApp } from 'vue'
      const app = createApp(/* ... */)

      app.mount('#app')
      ```

      Can also mount to an actual DOM element:

    ## defineComponent()

    A type helper for defining a Vue component with type inference.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      // options syntax
      function defineComponent(
        component: ComponentOptions
      ): ComponentConstructor

      // function syntax (requires 3.3+)
      function defineComponent(
        setup: ComponentOptions['setup'],
        extraOptions?: ComponentOptions
      ): () => any
      ```

      > Type is simplified for readability.

    - **Details**

      The first argument expects a component options object. The return value will be the same options object, since the function is essentially a runtime no-op for type inference purposes only.

      Note that the return type is a bit special: it will be a constructor type whose instance type is the inferred component instance type based on the options. This is used for type inference when the returned type is used as a tag in TSX.

      You can extract the instance type of a component (equivalent to the type of `this` in its options) from the return type of `defineComponent()` like this:

      ``` ts
      const Foo = defineComponent(/* ... */)

      type FooInstance = InstanceType<typeof Foo>
      ```

      ### Function Signature

      `defineComponent()` also has an alternative signature that is meant to be used with Composition API and [render functions or JSX](../guide/extras/render-function).

      Instead of passing in an options object, a function is expected instead. This function works the same as the Composition API [`setup()`](composition-api-setup#composition-api-setup) function: it receives the props and the setup context. The return value should be a render function - both `h()` and JSX are supported:

      ``` js
      import { ref, h } from 'vue'

      const Comp = defineComponent(
        (props) => {
          // use Composition API here like in <script setup>
          const count = ref(0)

          return () => {
            // render function or JSX
            return h('div', count.value)
          }
        },
        // extra options, e.g. declare props and emits
        {
          props: {
            /* ... */
          }
        }
      )
      ```

      The main use case for this signature is with TypeScript (and in particular with TSX), as it supports generics:

      ``` tsx
      const Comp = defineComponent(
        <T extends string | number>(props: { msg: T; list: T[] }) => {
          // use Composition API here like in <script setup>
          const count = ref(0)

          return () => {
            // render function or JSX
            return <div>{count.value}</div>
          }
        },
        // manual runtime props declaration is currently still needed.
        {
          props: ['msg', 'list']
        }
      )
      ```

      In the future, we plan to provide a Babel plugin that automatically infers and injects the runtime props (like for `defineProps` in SFCs) so that the runtime props declaration can be omitted.

      ### Note on webpack Treeshaking

      Because `defineComponent()` is a function call, it could look like that it would produce side-effects to some build tools, e.g. webpack. This will prevent the component from being tree-shaken even when the component is never used.

      To tell webpack that this function call is safe to be tree-shaken, you can add a `/*#__PURE__*/` comment notation before the function call:

      ``` js
      export default /*#__PURE__*/ defineComponent(/* ... */)
      ```

      Note this is not necessary if you are using Vite, because Rollup (the underlying production bundler used by Vite) is smart enough to determine that `defineComponent()` is in fact side-effect-free without the need for manual annotations.

    A utility for waiting for the next DOM update flush.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts

      ```

    - **Details**

      When you mutate reactive state in Vue, the resulting DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

      `nextTick()` can be used immediately after a state change to wait for the DOM updates to complete. You can either pass a callback as an argument, or await the returned Promise.

    - **Example**

      ``` javascript

      const count = ref(0)

      async function increment() {
        count.value++

      [Fallthrough Attributes](../guide/components/attrs) are attributes and event handlers passed by the parent component, but not declared as a prop or an emitted event by the child.

      By default, everything in `$attrs` will be automatically inherited on the component's root element if there is only a single root element. This behavior is disabled if the component has multiple root nodes, and can be explicitly disabled with the [`inheritAttrs`](options-misc#inheritattrs) option.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentPublicInstance {
        $el: Node | undefined
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      `$el` will be `undefined` until the component is [mounted](options-lifecycle#mounted).

      - For components with a single root element, `$el` will point to that element.
      - For components with text root, `$el` will point to the text node.
      - For components with multiple root nodes, `$el` will be the placeholder DOM node that Vue uses to keep track of the component's position in the DOM (a text node, or a comment node in SSR hydration mode).

      **TIP**
      For consistency, it is recommended to use [template refs](../guide/essentials/template-refs) for direct access to elements instead of relying on `$el`.

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentPublicInstance {
        $slots: { [name: string]: Slot }
      }

      type Slot = (...args: any[]) => VNode[]
      ```

    - **Details**

      Typically used when manually authoring [render functions](../guide/extras/render-function), but can also be used to detect whether a slot is present.

      Each slot is exposed on `this.$slots` as a function that returns an array of vnodes under the key corresponding to that slot's name. The default slot is exposed as `this.$slots.default`.

      If a slot is a [scoped slot](../guide/components/slots#scoped-slots), arguments passed to the slot functions are available to the slot as its slot props.

    ## $watch()

    Imperative API for creating watchers.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentPublicInstance {
        $watch(
          source: string | (() => any),
          callback: WatchCallback,
          options?: WatchOptions
        ): StopHandle
      }

      type WatchCallback<T> = (
        value: T,
        oldValue: T,
        onCleanup: (cleanupFn: () => void) => void
      ) => void

      interface WatchOptions {
        immediate?: boolean // default: false
        deep?: boolean // default: false
        flush?: 'pre' | 'post' | 'sync' // default: 'pre'
        onTrack?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
        onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
      }

      type StopHandle = () => void
      ```

    - **Details**

      The first argument is the watch source. It can be a component property name string, a simple dot-delimited path string, or a getter function.

      The second argument is the callback function. The callback receives the new value and the old value of the watched source.

      - **`immediate`**: trigger the callback immediately on watcher creation. Old value will be `undefined` on the first call.
      - **`deep`**: force deep traversal of the source if it is an object, so that the callback fires on deep mutations. See [Deep Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers#deep-watchers).
      - **`flush`**: adjust the callback's flush timing. See [Callback Flush Timing](../guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) and [`watchEffect()`](reactivity-core#watcheffect).
      - **`onTrack / onTrigger`**: debug the watcher's dependencies. See [Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging).

    - **Example**

      Watch a property name:

      ``` js
      this.$watch('a', (newVal, oldVal) => {})
      ```

      Watch a dot-delimited path:

      ``` js
      this.$watch('a.b', (newVal, oldVal) => {})
      ```

      Using getter for more complex expressions:

      ``` js
      this.$watch(
        // every time the expression `this.a + this.b` yields
        // a different result, the handler will be called.
        // It's as if we were watching a computed property
        // without defining the computed property itself.
        () => this.a + this.b,
        (newVal, oldVal) => {}
      )
      ```

      Stopping the watcher:

      ``` js
      const unwatch = this.$watch('a', cb)

      // later...
      unwatch()
      ```

    - **Details**

      The option accepts an object where the key is the name of the computed property, and the value is either a computed getter, or an object with `get` and `set` methods (for writable computed properties).

      All getters and setters have their `this` context automatically bound to the component instance.

      Note that if you use an arrow function with a computed property, `this` won't point to the component's instance, but you can still access the instance as the function's first argument:

      ``` js
      export default {
        computed: {
          aDouble: (vm) => vm.a * 2
        }
      }
      ```

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      export default {
        data() {
          return { a: 1 }
        },
        computed: {
          // readonly
          aDouble() {

            },
            set(v) {
              this.a = v - 1
            }
          }
        },
        created() {

    ## data

    A function that returns the initial reactive state for the component instance.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        data?(
          this: ComponentPublicInstance,
          vm: ComponentPublicInstance
        ): object
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The function is expected to return a plain JavaScript object, which will be made reactive by Vue. After the instance is created, the reactive data object can be accessed as `this.$data`. The component instance also proxies all the properties found on the data object, so `this.a` will be equivalent to `this.$data.a`.

      All top-level data properties must be included in the returned data object. Adding new properties to `this.$data` is possible, but it is **not** recommended. If the desired value of a property is not yet available then an empty value such as `undefined` or `null` should be included as a placeholder to ensure that Vue knows that the property exists.

      Properties that start with `_` or `$` will **not** be proxied on the component instance because they may conflict with Vue's internal properties and API methods. You will have to access them as `this.$data._property`.

      It is **not** recommended to return objects with their own stateful behavior like browser API objects and prototype properties. The returned object should ideally be a plain object that only represents the state of the component.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      export default {
        data() {
          return { a: 1 }
        },
        created() {
          console.log(this.a) // 1
          console.log(this.$data) // { a: 1 }
        }
      }
      ```

      Note that if you use an arrow function with the `data` property, `this` won't be the component's instance, but you can still access the instance as the function's first argument:

      ``` js
      data: (vm) => ({ a: vm.myProp })

    ## emits

    Declare the custom events emitted by the component.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        emits?: ArrayEmitsOptions | ObjectEmitsOptions
      }

      type ArrayEmitsOptions = string[]

      type ObjectEmitsOptions = { [key: string]: EmitValidator | null }

      type EmitValidator = (...args: unknown[]) => boolean
      ```

    - **Details**

      Emitted events can be declared in two forms:

      - Simple form using an array of strings
      - Full form using an object where each property key is the name of the event, and the value is either `null` or a validator function.

      The validation function will receive the additional arguments passed to the component's `$emit` call. For example, if `this.$emit('foo', 1)` is called, the corresponding validator for `foo` will receive the argument `1`. The validator function should return a boolean to indicate whether the event arguments are valid.

      Note that the `emits` option affects which event listeners are considered component event listeners, rather than native DOM event listeners. The listeners for declared events will be removed from the component's `$attrs` object, so they will not be passed through to the component's root element. See [Fallthrough Attributes](../guide/components/attrs) for more details.

    - **Example**

      Array syntax:

      ``` js
      export default {
        emits: ['check'],

        }

    ## errorCaptured

    Called when an error propagating from a descendant component has been captured.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        errorCaptured?(
          this: ComponentPublicInstance,
          err: unknown,
          instance: ComponentPublicInstance | null,
          info: string
        ): boolean | void
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      Errors can be captured from the following sources:

      - Component renders
      - Event handlers
      - Lifecycle hooks
      - `setup()` function
      - Watchers
      - Custom directive hooks
      - Transition hooks

      The hook receives three arguments: the error, the component instance that triggered the error, and an information string specifying the error source type.

      **TIP**
      In production, the 3rd argument (`info`) will be a shortened code instead of the full information string. You can find the code to string mapping in the [Production Error Code Reference](https://vuejs.org/error-reference/#runtime-errors).

      You can modify component state in `errorCaptured()` to display an error state to the user. However, it is important that the error state should not render the original content that caused the error; otherwise the component will be thrown into an infinite render loop.

      The hook can return `false` to stop the error from propagating further. See error propagation details below.

      **Error Propagation Rules**

      - By default, all errors are still sent to the application-level [`app.config.errorHandler`](application#app-config-errorhandler) if it is defined, so that these errors can still be reported to an analytics service in a single place.

      - If multiple `errorCaptured` hooks exist on a component's inheritance chain or parent chain, all of them will be invoked on the same error, in the order of bottom to top. This is similar to the bubbling mechanism of native DOM events.

      - If the `errorCaptured` hook itself throws an error, both this error and the original captured error are sent to `app.config.errorHandler`.

      - An `errorCaptured` hook can return `false` to prevent the error from propagating further. This is essentially saying "this error has been handled and should be ignored." It will prevent any additional `errorCaptured` hooks or `app.config.errorHandler` from being invoked for this error.

This can be undesirable, since a component most likely has internal state or methods that should be kept private to avoid tight coupling.\n\n  The `expose` option expects a list of property name strings. When `expose` is used, only the properties explicitly listed will be exposed on the component's public instance.\n\n  `expose` only affects user-defined properties - it does not filter out built-in component instance properties.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    // only `publicMethod` will be available on the public instance\n    expose: ['publicMethod'],\n    methods: {\n      publicMethod() {\n        // ...\n      },\n      privateMethod() {\n        // ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/options-state](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state)"

The component specified by `extends` will be treated as though it were the first mixin.\n\n  However, `extends` and `mixins` express different intents. The `mixins` option is primarily used to compose chunks of functionality, whereas `extends` is primarily concerned with inheritance.\n\n  As with `mixins`, any options (except for `setup()`) will be merged using the relevant merge strategy.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const CompA = { ... }\n\n  const CompB = {\n    extends: CompA,\n    ...\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Not Recommended for Composition API**\n  `extends` is designed for Options API and does not handle the merging of the `setup()` hook.\n\n  In Composition API, the preferred mental model for logic reuse is \"compose\" over \"inheritance\". If you have logic from a component that needs to be reused in another one, consider extracting the relevant logic into a [Composable](../guide/reusability/composables#composables).\n\n  If you still intend to \"extend\" a component using Composition API, you can call the base component's `setup()` in the extending component's `setup()`:\n\n  ``` js\n  import Base from './Base.js'\n  export default {\n    extends: Base,\n    setup(props, ctx) {\n      return {\n        ...Base.setup(props, ctx),\n        // local bindings\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/options-composition](https://vuejs.org/api/options-composition)"

    ## inheritAttrs

    Controls whether the default component attribute fallthrough behavior should be enabled.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        inheritAttrs?: boolean // default: true
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      By default, parent scope attribute bindings that are not recognized as props will "fallthrough". This means that when we have a single-root component, these bindings will be applied to the root element of the child component as normal HTML attributes. When authoring a component that wraps a target element or another component, this may not always be the desired behavior. By setting `inheritAttrs` to `false`, this default behavior can be disabled. The attributes are available via the `$attrs` instance property and can be explicitly bound to a non-root element using `v-bind`.

    - **Example**

      ``` javascript
      <script>
      export default {
        inheritAttrs: false,
        props: ['label', 'value'],
        emits: ['input']
      }
      </script>

      <template>
        <label>
          {{ label }}
          <input
            v-bind="$attrs"
            v-bind:value="value"
            v-on:input="$emit('input', $event.target.value)"
          />
        </label>
      </template>
      ```

      When declaring this option in a component that uses `<script setup>`, you can use the [`defineOptions`](sfc-script-setup#defineoptions) macro:

      ``` javascript
      <script setup>
      defineProps(['label', 'value'])
      defineEmits(['input'])
      defineOptions({
        inheritAttrs: false
      })
      </script>

      <template>
        <label>
          {{ label }}
          <input
            v-bind="$attrs"
            v-bind:value="value"
            v-on:input="$emit('input', $event.target.value)"
          />
        </label>
      </template>
      ```

  summary: Declare properties to inject into the current component by locating them from ancestor providers

  description: |-
    ## inject

    Declare properties to inject into the current component by locating them from ancestor providers.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        inject?: ArrayInjectOptions | ObjectInjectOptions
      }

      type ArrayInjectOptions = string[]

      type ObjectInjectOptions = {
        [key: string | symbol]:
          | string
          | symbol
          | { from?: string | symbol; default?: any }
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The `inject` option should be either:

      - An array of strings, or
      - An object where the keys are the local binding name and the value is either:
        - The key (string or Symbol) to search for in available injections, or
        - An object where:
          - The `from` property is the key (string or Symbol) to search for in available injections, and
          - The `default` property is used as fallback value. Similar to props default values, a factory function is needed for object types to avoid value sharing between multiple component instances.

      An injected property will be `undefined` if neither a matching property nor a default value was provided.

      Note that injected bindings are NOT reactive. This is intentional. However, if the injected value is a reactive object, properties on that object do remain reactive. See [Working with Reactivity](../guide/components/provide-inject#working-with-reactivity) for more details.

    - **Example**

      Basic usage:

      ``` js
      export default {
        inject: ['foo'],
        created() {
          console.log(this.foo)
        }
      }
      ```

      Using an injected value as the default for a prop:

      ``` js
      const Child = {
        inject: ['foo'],
        props: {
          bar: {
            default() {
              return this.foo
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      Using an injected value as data entry:

      ``` js
      const Child = {
        inject: ['foo'],
        data() {
          return {
            bar: this.foo
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      Injections can be optional with default value:

      ``` js
      const Child = {
        inject: {
          foo: { default: 'foo' }
        }
      }
      ```

      If it needs to be injected from a property with a different name, use `from` to denote the source property:

      ``` js
      const Child = {
        inject: {
          foo: {
            from: 'bar',
            default: 'foo'
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      Similar to prop defaults, you need to use a factory function for non-primitive values:

      ``` js
      const Child = {
        inject: {
          foo: {
            from: 'bar',
            default: () => [1, 2, 3]
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    ## methods

    Declare methods to be mixed into the component instance.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        methods?: {
          [key: string]: (this: ComponentPublicInstance, ...args: any[]) => any
        }
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      Declared methods can be directly accessed on the component instance, or used in template expressions. All methods have their `this` context automatically bound to the component instance, even when passed around.

      Avoid using arrow functions when declaring methods, as they will not have access to the component instance via `this`.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      export default {
        data() {
          return { a: 1 }
        },
        methods: {
          plus() {
            this.a++
          }
        },
        created() {
          this.plus()
          console.log(this.a) // => 2
        }
      }
      ```

    ## mixins

    An array of option objects to be mixed into the current component.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        mixins?: ComponentOptions[]
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The `mixins` option accepts an array of mixin objects. These mixin objects can contain instance options like normal instance objects, and they will be merged against the eventual options using the certain option merging logic. For example, if your mixin contains a `created` hook and the component itself also has one, both functions will be called.

      Mixin hooks are called in the order they are provided, and called before the component's own hooks.

      **No Longer Recommended**
      In Vue 2, mixins were the primary mechanism for creating reusable chunks of component logic. While mixins continue to be supported in Vue 3, [Composable functions using Composition API](../guide/reusability/composables) is now the preferred approach for code reuse between components.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      const mixin = {
        created() {
          console.log(1)
        }
      }

      createApp({
        created() {
          console.log(2)
        },
        mixins: [mixin]
      })

      // => 1
      // => 2
      ```

    ## mounted

    Called after the component has been mounted.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        mounted?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      A component is considered mounted after:

      - All of its synchronous child components have been mounted (does not include async components or components inside `<Suspense>` trees).

      - Its own DOM tree has been created and inserted into the parent container. Note it only guarantees that the component's DOM tree is in-document if the application's root container is also in-document.

      This hook is typically used for performing side effects that need access to the component's rendered DOM, or for limiting DOM-related code to the client in a [server-rendered application](../guide/scaling-up/ssr).

      **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**

    ## name

    Explicitly declare a display name for the component.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        name?: string
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      The name of a component is used for the following:

      - Recursive self-reference in the component's own template
      - Display in Vue DevTools' component inspection tree
      - Display in warning component traces

      When you use Single-File Components, the component already infers its own name from the filename. For example, a file named `MyComponent.vue` will have the inferred display name "MyComponent".

      Another case is that when a component is registered globally with [`app.component`](application#app-component), the global ID is automatically set as its name.

      The `name` option allows you to override the inferred name, or to explicitly provide a name when no name can be inferred (e.g. when not using build tools, or an inlined non-SFC component).

      There is one case where `name` is explicitly necessary: when matching against cacheable components in [`<KeepAlive>`](../guide/built-ins/keep-alive) via its `include / exclude` props.

      **TIP**
      Since version 3.2.34, a single-file component using `<script setup>` will automatically infer its `name` option based on the filename, removing the need to manually declare the name even when used with `<KeepAlive>`.

        validator?: (value: unknown, rawProps: object) => boolean
      }

      type PropType<T> = { new (): T } | { new (): T }[]
      ```

      > Types are simplified for readability.

    - **Details**

      In Vue, all component props need to be explicitly declared. Component props can be declared in two forms:

      - Simple form using an array of strings
      - Full form using an object where each property key is the name of the prop, and the value is the prop's type (a constructor function) or advanced options.

      With object-based syntax, each prop can further define the following options:

      - **`type`**: Can be one of the following native constructors: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Object`, `Date`, `Function`, `Symbol`, any custom constructor function or an array of those. In development mode, Vue will check if a prop's value matches the declared type, and will throw a warning if it doesn't. See [Prop Validation](../guide/components/props#prop-validation) for more details.

        Also note that a prop with `Boolean` type affects its value casting behavior in both development and production. See [Boolean Casting](../guide/components/props#boolean-casting) for more details.

      - **`default`**: Specifies a default value for the prop when it is not passed by the parent or has `undefined` value. Object or array defaults must be returned using a factory function. The factory function also receives the raw props object as the argument.

      - **`required`**: Defines if the prop is required. In a non-production environment, a console warning will be thrown if this value is truthy and the prop is not passed.

      - **`validator`**: Custom validator function that takes the prop value as the sole argument. In development mode, a console warning will be thrown if this function returns a falsy value (i.e. the validation fails).

    - **Example**

      Simple declaration:

      ``` js
      export default {
        props: ['size', 'myMessage']
      }
      ```

      Object declaration with validations:

      ``` js
      export default {
        props: {
          // type check
          height: Number,
          // type check plus other validations
          age: {
            type: Number,
            default: 0,
            required: true,
            validator: (value) => {
              return value >= 0
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    ## provide

    Provide values that can be injected by descendant components.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        provide?: object | ((this: ComponentPublicInstance) => object)
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      `provide` and [`inject`](#inject) are used together to allow an ancestor component to serve as a dependency injector for all its descendants, regardless of how deep the component hierarchy is, as long as they are in the same parent chain.

      The `provide` option should be either an object or a function that returns an object. This object contains the properties that are available for injection into its descendants. You can use Symbols as keys in this object.

    - **Example**

      Basic usage:

      ``` js
      const s = Symbol()

      export default {
        provide: {
          foo: 'foo',
          [s]: 'bar'
        }
      }
      ```

      Using a function to provide per-component state:

      ``` js
      export default {
        data() {
          return {
            msg: 'foo'
          }
        }
        provide() {
          return {
            msg: this.msg
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      Note in the above example, the provided `msg` will NOT be reactive. See [Working with Reactivity](../guide/components/provide-inject#working-with-reactivity) for more details.

        | undefined
        | void

      type VNodeArrayChildren = (VNodeArrayChildren | VNodeChildAtom)[]
      ```

    - **Details**

      `render` is an alternative to string templates that allows you to leverage the full programmatic power of JavaScript to declare the render output of the component.

      Pre-compiled templates, for example those in Single-File Components, are compiled into the `render` option at build time. If both `render` and `template` are present in a component, `render` will take higher priority.

    ## template

    A string template for the component.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        template?: string
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      A template provided via the `template` option will be compiled on-the-fly at runtime. It is only supported when using a build of Vue that includes the template compiler. The template compiler is **NOT** included in Vue builds that have the word `runtime` in their names, e.g. `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`. Consult the [dist file guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#which-dist-file-to-use) for more details about the different builds.

      If the string starts with `#` it will be used as a `querySelector` and use the selected element's `innerHTML` as the template string. This allows the source template to be authored using native `<template>` elements.

      If the `render` option is also present in the same component, `template` will be ignored.

      If the root component of your application doesn't have a `template` or `render` option specified, Vue will try to use the `innerHTML` of the mounted element as the template instead.

      **Security Note**
      Only use template sources that you can trust. Do not use user-provided content as your template. See [Security Guide](../guide/best-practices/security#rule-no-1-never-use-non-trusted-templates) for more details.

    ## unmounted

    Called after the component has been unmounted.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        unmounted?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      A component is considered unmounted after:

      - All of its child components have been unmounted.

      - All of its associated reactive effects (render effect and computed / watchers created during `setup()`) have been stopped.

      Use this hook to clean up manually created side effects such as timers, DOM event listeners or server connections.

      **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**

    ## updated

    Called after the component has updated its DOM tree due to a reactive state change.

    - **Type**

      ``` ts
      interface ComponentOptions {
        updated?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void
      }
      ```

    - **Details**

      A parent component's updated hook is called after that of its child components.

      This hook is called after any DOM update of the component, which can be caused by different state changes. If you need to access the updated DOM after a specific state change, use [nextTick()](general#nexttick) instead.

      **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**

      **WARNING**
      Do not mutate component state in the updated hook - this will likely lead to an infinite update loop!

        onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
      }
      ```

      > Types are simplified for readability.

    - **Details**

      The `watch` option expects an object where keys are the reactive component instance properties to watch (e.g. properties declared via `data` or `computed`) — and values are the corresponding callbacks. The callback receives the new value and the old value of the watched source.

      In addition to a root-level property, the key can also be a simple dot-delimited path, e.g. `a.b.c`. Note that this usage does **not** support complex expressions - only dot-delimited paths are supported. If you need to watch complex data sources, use the imperative [`$watch()`](component-instance#watch) API instead.

      The value can also be a string of a method name (declared via `methods`), or an object that contains additional options. When using the object syntax, the callback should be declared under the `handler` field. Additional options include:

      - **`immediate`**: trigger the callback immediately on watcher creation. Old value will be `undefined` on the first call.
      - **`deep`**: force deep traversal of the source if it is an object or an array, so that the callback fires on deep mutations. See [Deep Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers#deep-watchers).
      - **`flush`**: adjust the callback's flush timing. See [Callback Flush Timing](../guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) and [`watchEffect()`](reactivity-core#watcheffect).
      - **`onTrack / onTrigger`**: debug the watcher's dependencies. See [Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging).

      Avoid using arrow functions when declaring watch callbacks as they will not have access to the component instance via `this`.

    - **Example**

      ``` js
      export default {
        data() {
          return {
            a: 1,

  summary: Provide values that can be injected by descendant components
  description: "# Options: Composition\n\n## provide\n\nProvide values that can be injected by descendant components.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    provide?: object | ((this: ComponentPublicInstance) => object)\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `provide` and [`inject`](#inject) are used together to allow an ancestor component to serve as a dependency injector for all its descendants, regardless of how deep the component hierarchy is, as long as they are in the same parent chain.\n\n  The `provide` option should be either an object or a function that returns an object. This object contains the properties that are available for injection into its descendants. You can use Symbols as keys in this object.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Basic usage:\n\n  ``` js\n  const s = Symbol()\n\n  export default {\n    provide: {\n      foo: 'foo',\n      [s]: 'bar'\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Using a function to provide per-component state:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        msg: 'foo'\n      }\n    }\n    provide() {\n      return {\n        msg: this.msg\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Note in the above example, the provided `msg` will NOT be reactive. See [Working with Reactivity](../guide/components/provide-inject#working-with-reactivity) for more details.\n\n- **See also** [Provide / Inject](../guide/components/provide-inject)\n\n## inject\n\nDeclare properties to inject into the current component by locating them from ancestor providers.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    inject?: ArrayInjectOptions | ObjectInjectOptions\n  }\n\n  type ArrayInjectOptions = string[]\n\n  type ObjectInjectOptions = {\n    [key: string | symbol]:\n      | string\n      | symbol\n      | { from?: string | symbol; default?: any }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The `inject` option should be either:\n\n  - An array of strings, or\n  - An object where the keys are the local binding name and the value is either:\n    - The key (string or Symbol) to search for in available injections, or\n    - An object where:\n      - The `from` property is the key (string or Symbol) to search for in available injections, and\n      - The `default` property is used as fallback value. Similar to props default values, a factory function is needed for object types to avoid value sharing between multiple component instances.\n\n  An injected property will be `undefined` if neither a matching property nor a default value was provided.\n\n  Note that injected bindings are NOT reactive. This is intentional. However, if the injected value is a reactive object, properties on that object do remain reactive. See [Working with Reactivity](../guide/components/provide-inject#working-with-reactivity) for more details.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Basic usage:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    inject: ['foo'],\n    created() {\n      console.log(this.foo)\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Using an injected value as the default for a prop:\n\n  ``` js\n  const Child = {\n    inject: ['foo'],\n    props: {\n      bar: {\n        default() {\n          return this.foo\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Using an injected value as data entry:\n\n  ``` js\n  const Child = {\n    inject: ['foo'],\n    data() {\n      return {\n        bar: this.foo\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Injections can be optional with default value:\n\n  ``` js\n  const Child = {\n    inject: {\n      foo: { default: 'foo' }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  If it needs to be injected from a property with a different name, use `from` to denote the source property:\n\n  ``` js\n  const Child = {\n    inject: {\n      foo: {\n        from: 'bar',\n        default: 'foo'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Similar to prop defaults, you need to use a factory function for non-primitive values:\n\n  ``` js\n  const Child = {\n    inject: {\n      foo: {\n        from: 'bar',\n        default: () => [1, 2, 3]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Provide / Inject](../guide/components/provide-inject)\n\n## mixins\n\nAn array of option objects to be mixed into the current component.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    mixins?: ComponentOptions[]\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The `mixins` option accepts an array of mixin objects. These mixin objects can contain instance options like normal instance objects, and they will be merged against the eventual options using the certain option merging logic. For example, if your mixin contains a `created` hook and the component itself also has one, both functions will be called.\n\n  Mixin hooks are called in the order they are provided, and called before the component's own hooks.\n\n  **No Longer Recommended**\n  In Vue 2, mixins were the primary mechanism for creating reusable chunks of component logic. While mixins continue to be supported in Vue 3, [Composable functions using Composition API](../guide/reusability/composables) is now the preferred approach for code reuse between components.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const mixin = {\n    created() {\n      console.log(1)\n    }\n  }\n\n  createApp({\n    created() {\n      console.log(2)\n    },\n    mixins: [mixin]\n  })\n\n  // => 1\n  // => 2\n  ```\n\n## extends\n\nA \"base class\" component to extend from.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    extends?: ComponentOptions\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Allows one component to extend another, inheriting its component options.\n\n  From an implementation perspective, `extends` is almost identical to `mixins`. The component specified by `extends` will be treated as though it were the first mixin.\n\n  However, `extends` and `mixins` express different intents. The `mixins` option is primarily used to compose chunks of functionality, whereas `extends` is primarily concerned with inheritance.\n\n  As with `mixins`, any options (except for `setup()`) will be merged using the relevant merge strategy.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const CompA = { ... }\n\n  const CompB = {\n    extends: CompA,\n    ...\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Not Recommended for Composition API**\n  `extends` is designed for Options API and does not handle the merging of the `setup()` hook.\n\n  In Composition API, the preferred mental model for logic reuse is \"compose\" over \"inheritance\". If you have logic from a component that needs to be reused in another one, consider extracting the relevant logic into a [Composable](../guide/reusability/composables#composables).\n\n  If you still intend to \"extend\" a component using Composition API, you can call the base component's `setup()` in the extending component's `setup()`:\n\n  ``` js\n  import Base from './Base.js'\n  export default {\n    extends: Base,\n    setup(props, ctx) {\n      return {\n        ...Base.setup(props, ctx),\n        // local bindings\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/options-composition](https://vuejs.org/api/options-composition)"

Note it only guarantees that the component's DOM tree is in-document if the application's root container is also in-document.\n\n  This hook is typically used for performing side effects that need access to the component's rendered DOM, or for limiting DOM-related code to the client in a [server-rendered application](../guide/scaling-up/ssr).\n\n  **This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n## beforeUpdate\n\nCalled right before the component is about to update its DOM tree due to a reactive state change.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    beforeUpdate?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  This hook can be used to access the DOM state before Vue updates the DOM.

You can find the code to string mapping in the [Production Error Code Reference](https://vuejs.org/error-reference/#runtime-errors).\n\n  You can modify component state in `errorCaptured()` to display an error state to the user. However, it is important that the error state should not render the original content that caused the error; otherwise the component will be thrown into an infinite render loop.\n\n  The hook can return `false` to stop the error from propagating further. See error propagation details below.\n\n  **Error Propagation Rules**\n\n  - By default, all errors are still sent to the application-level [`app.config.errorHandler`](application#app-config-errorhandler) if it is defined, so that these errors can still be reported to an analytics service in a single place.\n\n  - If multiple `errorCaptured` hooks exist on a component's inheritance chain or parent chain, all of them will be invoked on the same error, in the order of bottom to top. This is similar to the bubbling mechanism of native DOM events.\n\n  - If the `errorCaptured` hook itself throws an error, both this error and the original captured error are sent to `app.config.errorHandler`.\n\n  - An `errorCaptured` hook can return `false` to prevent the error from propagating further. This is essentially saying \"this error has been handled and should be ignored.\" It will prevent any additional `errorCaptured` hooks or `app.config.errorHandler` from being invoked for this error.\n\n## renderTracked\n\nCalled when a reactive dependency has been tracked by the component's render effect.\n\n**This hook is development-mode-only and not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    renderTracked?(this: ComponentPublicInstance, e: DebuggerEvent): void\n  }\n\n  type DebuggerEvent = {\n    effect: ReactiveEffect\n    target: object\n    type: TrackOpTypes /* 'get' | 'has' | 'iterate' */\n    key: any\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Reactivity in Depth](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth)\n\n## renderTriggered\n\nCalled when a reactive dependency triggers the component's render effect to be re-run.\n\n**This hook is development-mode-only and not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    renderTriggered?(this: ComponentPublicInstance, e: DebuggerEvent): void\n  }\n\n  type DebuggerEvent = {\n    effect: ReactiveEffect\n    target: object\n    type: TriggerOpTypes /* 'set' | 'add' | 'delete' | 'clear' */\n    key: any\n    newValue?: any\n    oldValue?: any\n    oldTarget?: Map<any, any> | Set<any>\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Reactivity in Depth](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth)\n\n## activated\n\nCalled after the component instance is inserted into the DOM as part of a tree cached by [`<KeepAlive>`](built-in-components#keepalive).\n\n**This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    activated?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Lifecycle of Cached Instance](../guide/built-ins/keep-alive#lifecycle-of-cached-instance)\n\n## deactivated\n\nCalled after the component instance is removed from the DOM as part of a tree cached by [`<KeepAlive>`](built-in-components#keepalive).\n\n**This hook is not called during server-side rendering.**\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    deactivated?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Lifecycle of Cached Instance](../guide/built-ins/keep-alive#lifecycle-of-cached-instance)\n\n## serverPrefetch\n\nAsync function to be resolved before the component instance is to be rendered on the server.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    serverPrefetch?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): Promise<any>\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  If the hook returns a Promise, the server renderer will wait until the Promise is resolved before rendering the component.\n\n  This hook is only called during server-side rendering can be used to perform server-only data fetching.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        data: null\n      }\n    },\n    async serverPrefetch() {\n      // component is rendered as part of the initial request\n      // pre-fetch data on server as it is faster than on the client\n      this.data = await fetchOnServer(/* ... */)\n    },\n    async mounted() {\n      if (!this.data) {\n        // if data is null on mount, it means the component\n        // is dynamically rendered on the client.

  summary: Explicitly declare a display name for the component
  description: "# Options: Misc\n\n## name\n\nExplicitly declare a display name for the component.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    name?: string\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The name of a component is used for the following:\n\n  - Recursive self-reference in the component's own template\n  - Display in Vue DevTools' component inspection tree\n  - Display in warning component traces\n\n  When you use Single-File Components, the component already infers its own name from the filename. For example, a file named `MyComponent.vue` will have the inferred display name \"MyComponent\".\n\n  Another case is that when a component is registered globally with [`app.component`](application#app-component), the global ID is automatically set as its name.\n\n  The `name` option allows you to override the inferred name, or to explicitly provide a name when no name can be inferred (e.g. when not using build tools, or an inlined non-SFC component).\n\n  There is one case where `name` is explicitly necessary: when matching against cacheable components in [`<KeepAlive>`](../guide/built-ins/keep-alive) via its `include / exclude` props.\n\n  **TIP**\n  Since version 3.2.34, a single-file component using `<script setup>` will automatically infer its `name` option based on the filename, removing the need to manually declare the name even when used with `<KeepAlive>`.\n\n## inheritAttrs\n\nControls whether the default component attribute fallthrough behavior should be enabled.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    inheritAttrs?: boolean // default: true\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  By default, parent scope attribute bindings that are not recognized as props will \"fallthrough\". This means that when we have a single-root component, these bindings will be applied to the root element of the child component as normal HTML attributes. When authoring a component that wraps a target element or another component, this may not always be the desired behavior. By setting `inheritAttrs` to `false`, this default behavior can be disabled. The attributes are available via the `$attrs` instance property and can be explicitly bound to a non-root element using `v-bind`.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script>\n  export default {\n    inheritAttrs: false,\n    props: ['label', 'value'],\n    emits: ['input']\n  }\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <label>\n      {{ label }}\n      <input\n        v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n        v-bind:value=\"value\"\n        v-on:input=\"$emit('input', $event.target.value)\"\n      />\n    </label>\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n  When declaring this option in a component that uses `<script setup>`, you can use the [`defineOptions`](sfc-script-setup#defineoptions) macro:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  defineProps(['label', 'value'])\n  defineEmits(['input'])\n  defineOptions({\n    inheritAttrs: false\n  })\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <label>\n      {{ label }}\n      <input\n        v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n        v-bind:value=\"value\"\n        v-on:input=\"$emit('input', $event.target.value)\"\n      />\n    </label>\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Fallthrough Attributes](../guide/components/attrs)\n\n## components\n\nAn object that registers components to be made available to the component instance.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    components?: { [key: string]: Component }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import Foo from './Foo.vue'\n  import Bar from './Bar.vue'\n\n  export default {\n    components: {\n      // shorthand\n      Foo,\n      // register under a different name\n      RenamedBar: Bar\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Component Registration](../guide/components/registration)\n\n## directives\n\nAn object that registers directives to be made available to the component instance.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    directives?: { [key: string]: Directive }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    directives: {\n      // enables v-focus in template\n      focus: {\n        mounted(el) {\n          el.focus()\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ``` template\n  <input v-focus>\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Custom Directives](../guide/reusability/custom-directives)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/options-misc](https://vuejs.org/api/options-misc)"

  summary: A string template for the component
  description: "# Options: Rendering\n\n## template\n\nA string template for the component.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    template?: string\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  A template provided via the `template` option will be compiled on-the-fly at runtime. It is only supported when using a build of Vue that includes the template compiler. The template compiler is **NOT** included in Vue builds that have the word `runtime` in their names, e.g. `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`. Consult the [dist file guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#which-dist-file-to-use) for more details about the different builds.\n\n  If the string starts with `#` it will be used as a `querySelector` and use the selected element's `innerHTML` as the template string. This allows the source template to be authored using native `<template>` elements.\n\n  If the `render` option is also present in the same component, `template` will be ignored.\n\n  If the root component of your application doesn't have a `template` or `render` option specified, Vue will try to use the `innerHTML` of the mounted element as the template instead.\n\n  **Security Note**\n  Only use template sources that you can trust. Do not use user-provided content as your template. See [Security Guide](../guide/best-practices/security#rule-no-1-never-use-non-trusted-templates) for more details.\n\n## render\n\nA function that programmatically returns the virtual DOM tree of the component.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    render?(this: ComponentPublicInstance) => VNodeChild\n  }\n\n  type VNodeChild = VNodeChildAtom | VNodeArrayChildren\n\n  type VNodeChildAtom =\n    | VNode\n    | string\n    | number\n    | boolean\n    | null\n    | undefined\n    | void\n\n  type VNodeArrayChildren = (VNodeArrayChildren | VNodeChildAtom)[]\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `render` is an alternative to string templates that allows you to leverage the full programmatic power of JavaScript to declare the render output of the component.\n\n  Pre-compiled templates, for example those in Single-File Components, are compiled into the `render` option at build time. If both `render` and `template` are present in a component, `render` will take higher priority.\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Rendering Mechanism](../guide/extras/rendering-mechanism)\n  - [Render Functions](../guide/extras/render-function)\n\n## compilerOptions\n\nConfigure runtime compiler options for the component's template.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    compilerOptions?: {\n      isCustomElement?: (tag: string) => boolean\n      whitespace?: 'condense' | 'preserve' // default: 'condense'\n      delimiters?: [string, string] // default: ['{{', '}}']\n      comments?: boolean // default: false\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  This config option is only respected when using the full build (i.e. the standalone `vue.js` that can compile templates in the browser). It supports the same options as the app-level [app.config.compilerOptions](application#app-config-compileroptions), and has higher priority for the current component.\n\n- **See also** [app.config.compilerOptions](application#app-config-compileroptions)\n\n## slots\n\nAn option to assist with type inference when using slots programmatically in render functions. Only supported in 3.3+.\n\n- **Details**\n\n  This option's runtime value is not used. The actual types should be declared via type casting using the `SlotsType` type helper:\n\n  ``` ts\n  import { SlotsType } from 'vue'\n\n  defineComponent({\n    slots: Object as SlotsType<{\n      default: { foo: string; bar: number }\n      item: { data: number }\n    }>,\n    setup(props, { slots }) {\n      expectType<\n        undefined | ((scope: { foo: string; bar: number }) => any)\n      >(slots.default)\n      expectType<undefined | ((scope: { data: number }) => any)>(\n        slots.item\n      )\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/options-rendering](https://vuejs.org/api/options-rendering)"

  summary: A function that returns the initial reactive state for the component instance
  description: "# Options: State\n\n## data\n\nA function that returns the initial reactive state for the component instance.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    data?(\n      this: ComponentPublicInstance,\n      vm: ComponentPublicInstance\n    ): object\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The function is expected to return a plain JavaScript object, which will be made reactive by Vue. After the instance is created, the reactive data object can be accessed as `this.$data`. The component instance also proxies all the properties found on the data object, so `this.a` will be equivalent to `this.$data.a`.\n\n  All top-level data properties must be included in the returned data object. Adding new properties to `this.$data` is possible, but it is **not** recommended. If the desired value of a property is not yet available then an empty value such as `undefined` or `null` should be included as a placeholder to ensure that Vue knows that the property exists.\n\n  Properties that start with `_` or `$` will **not** be proxied on the component instance because they may conflict with Vue's internal properties and API methods. You will have to access them as `this.$data._property`.\n\n  It is **not** recommended to return objects with their own stateful behavior like browser API objects and prototype properties. The returned object should ideally be a plain object that only represents the state of the component.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return { a: 1 }\n    },\n    created() {\n      console.log(this.a) // 1\n      console.log(this.$data) // { a: 1 }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Note that if you use an arrow function with the `data` property, `this` won't be the component's instance, but you can still access the instance as the function's first argument:\n\n  ``` js\n  data: (vm) => ({ a: vm.myProp })\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Reactivity in Depth](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth)\n\n## props\n\nDeclare the props of a component.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    props?: ArrayPropsOptions | ObjectPropsOptions\n  }\n\n  type ArrayPropsOptions = string[]\n\n  type ObjectPropsOptions = { [key: string]: Prop }\n\n  type Prop<T = any> = PropOptions<T> | PropType<T> | null\n\n  interface PropOptions<T> {\n    type?: PropType<T>\n    required?: boolean\n    default?: T | ((rawProps: object) => T)\n    validator?: (value: unknown, rawProps: object) => boolean\n  }\n\n  type PropType<T> = { new (): T } | { new (): T }[]\n  ```\n\n  > Types are simplified for readability.\n\n- **Details**\n\n  In Vue, all component props need to be explicitly declared. Component props can be declared in two forms:\n\n  - Simple form using an array of strings\n  - Full form using an object where each property key is the name of the prop, and the value is the prop's type (a constructor function) or advanced options.\n\n  With object-based syntax, each prop can further define the following options:\n\n  - **`type`**: Can be one of the following native constructors: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Object`, `Date`, `Function`, `Symbol`, any custom constructor function or an array of those. In development mode, Vue will check if a prop's value matches the declared type, and will throw a warning if it doesn't. See [Prop Validation](../guide/components/props#prop-validation) for more details.\n\n    Also note that a prop with `Boolean` type affects its value casting behavior in both development and production. See [Boolean Casting](../guide/components/props#boolean-casting) for more details.\n\n  - **`default`**: Specifies a default value for the prop when it is not passed by the parent or has `undefined` value. Object or array defaults must be returned using a factory function. The factory function also receives the raw props object as the argument.\n\n  - **`required`**: Defines if the prop is required. In a non-production environment, a console warning will be thrown if this value is truthy and the prop is not passed.\n\n  - **`validator`**: Custom validator function that takes the prop value as the sole argument. In development mode, a console warning will be thrown if this function returns a falsy value (i.e. the validation fails).\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Simple declaration:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    props: ['size', 'myMessage']\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Object declaration with validations:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    props: {\n      // type check\n      height: Number,\n      // type check plus other validations\n      age: {\n        type: Number,\n        default: 0,\n        required: true,\n        validator: (value) => {\n          return value >= 0\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Props](../guide/components/props)\n  - [Guide - Typing Component Props](../guide/typescript/options-api#typing-component-props)\n\n## computed\n\nDeclare computed properties to be exposed on the component instance.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    computed?: {\n      [key: string]: ComputedGetter<any> | WritableComputedOptions<any>\n    }\n  }\n\n  type ComputedGetter<T> = (\n    this: ComponentPublicInstance,\n    vm: ComponentPublicInstance\n  ) => T\n\n  type ComputedSetter<T> = (\n    this: ComponentPublicInstance,\n    value: T\n  ) => void\n\n  type WritableComputedOptions<T> = {\n    get: ComputedGetter<T>\n    set: ComputedSetter<T>\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The option accepts an object where the key is the name of the computed property, and the value is either a computed getter, or an object with `get` and `set` methods (for writable computed properties).\n\n  All getters and setters have their `this` context automatically bound to the component instance.\n\n  Note that if you use an arrow function with a computed property, `this` won't point to the component's instance, but you can still access the instance as the function's first argument:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    computed: {\n      aDouble: (vm) => vm.a * 2\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return { a: 1 }\n    },\n    computed: {\n      // readonly\n      aDouble() {\n        return this.a * 2\n      },\n      // writable\n      aPlus: {\n        get() {\n          return this.a + 1\n        },\n        set(v) {\n          this.a = v - 1\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      console.log(this.aDouble) // => 2\n      console.log(this.aPlus) // => 2\n\n      this.aPlus = 3\n      console.log(this.a) // => 2\n      console.log(this.aDouble) // => 4\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Computed Properties](../guide/essentials/computed)\n  - [Guide - Typing Computed Properties](../guide/typescript/options-api#typing-computed-properties)\n\n## methods\n\nDeclare methods to be mixed into the component instance.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    methods?: {\n      [key: string]: (this: ComponentPublicInstance, ...args: any[]) => any\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Declared methods can be directly accessed on the component instance, or used in template expressions.

The callback receives the new value and the old value of the watched source.\n\n  In addition to a root-level property, the key can also be a simple dot-delimited path, e.g. `a.b.c`. Note that this usage does **not** support complex expressions - only dot-delimited paths are supported. If you need to watch complex data sources, use the imperative [`$watch()`](component-instance#watch) API instead.\n\n  The value can also be a string of a method name (declared via `methods`), or an object that contains additional options. When using the object syntax, the callback should be declared under the `handler` field. Additional options include:\n\n  - **`immediate`**: trigger the callback immediately on watcher creation. Old value will be `undefined` on the first call.\n  - **`deep`**: force deep traversal of the source if it is an object or an array, so that the callback fires on deep mutations. See [Deep Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers#deep-watchers).\n  - **`flush`**: adjust the callback's flush timing. See [Callback Flush Timing](../guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) and [`watchEffect()`](reactivity-core#watcheffect).\n  - **`onTrack / onTrigger`**: debug the watcher's dependencies. See [Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging).\n\n  Avoid using arrow functions when declaring watch callbacks as they will not have access to the component instance via `this`.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        a: 1,\n        b: 2,\n        c: {\n          d: 4\n        },\n        e: 5,\n        f: 6\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      // watching top-level property\n      a(val, oldVal) {\n        console.log(`new: ${val}, old: ${oldVal}`)\n      },\n      // string method name\n      b: 'someMethod',\n      // the callback will be called whenever any of the watched object properties change regardless of their nested depth\n      c: {\n        handler(val, oldVal) {\n          console.log('c changed')\n        },\n        deep: true\n      },\n      // watching a single nested property:\n      'c.d': function (val, oldVal) {\n        // do something\n      },\n      // the callback will be called immediately after the start of the observation\n      e: {\n        handler(val, oldVal) {\n          console.log('e changed')\n        },\n        immediate: true\n      },\n      // you can pass array of callbacks, they will be called one-by-one\n      f: [\n        'handle1',\n        function handle2(val, oldVal) {\n          console.log('handle2 triggered')\n        },\n        {\n          handler: function handle3(val, oldVal) {\n            console.log('handle3 triggered')\n          }\n          /* ... */\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    methods: {\n      someMethod() {\n        console.log('b changed')\n      },\n      handle1() {\n        console.log('handle 1 triggered')\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.a = 3 // => new: 3, old: 1\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers)\n\n## emits\n\nDeclare the custom events emitted by the component.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    emits?: ArrayEmitsOptions | ObjectEmitsOptions\n  }\n\n  type ArrayEmitsOptions = string[]\n\n  type ObjectEmitsOptions = { [key: string]: EmitValidator | null }\n\n  type EmitValidator = (...args: unknown[]) => boolean\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Emitted events can be declared in two forms:\n\n  - Simple form using an array of strings\n  - Full form using an object where each property key is the name of the event, and the value is either `null` or a validator function.\n\n  The validation function will receive the additional arguments passed to the component's `$emit` call. For example, if `this.$emit('foo', 1)` is called, the corresponding validator for `foo` will receive the argument `1`. The validator function should return a boolean to indicate whether the event arguments are valid.\n\n  Note that the `emits` option affects which event listeners are considered component event listeners, rather than native DOM event listeners. The listeners for declared events will be removed from the component's `$attrs` object, so they will not be passed through to the component's root element. See [Fallthrough Attributes](../guide/components/attrs) for more details.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Array syntax:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    emits: ['check'],\n    created() {\n      this.$emit('check')\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Object syntax:\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    emits: {\n      // no validation\n      click: null,\n\n      // with validation\n      submit: (payload) => {\n        if (payload.email && payload.password) {\n          return true\n        } else {\n          console.warn(`Invalid submit event payload!`)\n          return false\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Fallthrough Attributes](../guide/components/attrs)\n  - [Guide - Typing Component Emits](../guide/typescript/options-api#typing-component-emits)\n\n## expose\n\nDeclare exposed public properties when the component instance is accessed by a parent via template refs.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  interface ComponentOptions {\n    expose?: string[]\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  By default, a component instance exposes all instance properties to the parent when accessed via `$parent`, `$root`, or template refs. This can be undesirable, since a component most likely has internal state or methods that should be kept private to avoid tight coupling.\n\n  The `expose` option expects a list of property name strings. When `expose` is used, only the properties explicitly listed will be exposed on the component's public instance.\n\n  `expose` only affects user-defined properties - it does not filter out built-in component instance properties.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  export default {\n    // only `publicMethod` will be available on the public instance\n    expose: ['publicMethod'],\n    methods: {\n      publicMethod() {\n        // ...\n      },\n      privateMethod() {\n        // ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/options-state](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state)"

  summary: These rules help prevent errors, so learn and abide by them at all costs
  description: "# Priority A Rules: Essential\n\nThese rules help prevent errors, so learn and abide by them at all costs. Exceptions may exist, but should be very rare and only be made by those with expert knowledge of both JavaScript and Vue.\n\n## Use multi-word component names\n\nUser component names should always be multi-word, except for root `App` components. This [prevents conflicts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name) with existing and future HTML elements, since all HTML elements are a single word.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<!-- in pre-compiled templates -->\n<Item />\n\n<!-- in in-DOM templates -->\n<item></item>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<!-- in pre-compiled templates -->\n<TodoItem />\n\n<!-- in in-DOM templates -->\n<todo-item></todo-item>\n```\n\n## Use detailed prop definitions\n\nIn committed code, prop definitions should always be as detailed as possible, specifying at least type(s).\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nDetailed [prop definitions](../guide/components/props#prop-validation) have two advantages:\n\n- They document the API of the component, so that it's easy to see how the component is meant to be used.\n- In development, Vue will warn you if a component is ever provided incorrectly formatted props, helping you catch potential sources of error.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` js\n// This is only OK when prototyping\nprops: ['status']\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` js\nprops: {\n  status: String\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// Even better!\nprops: {\n  status: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n\n    validator: value => {\n      return [\n        'syncing',\n        'synced',\n        'version-conflict',\n        'error'\n      ].includes(value)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Bad\n\n``` js\n// This is only OK when prototyping\nconst props = defineProps(['status'])\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` js\nconst props = defineProps({\n  status: String\n})\n```\n\n``` js\n// Even better!\n\nconst props = defineProps({\n  status: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n\n    validator: (value) => {\n      return ['syncing', 'synced', 'version-conflict', 'error'].includes(\n        value\n      )\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Use keyed `v-for`\n\n`key` with `v-for` is *always* required on components, in order to maintain internal component state down the subtree. Even for elements though, it's a good practice to maintain predictable behavior, such as [object constancy](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/) in animations.\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nLet's say you have a list of todos:\n\n``` js\ndata() {\n  return {\n    todos: [\n      {\n        id: 1,\n        text: 'Learn to use v-for'\n      },\n      {\n        id: 2,\n        text: 'Learn to use key'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst todos = ref([\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    text: 'Learn to use v-for'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    text: 'Learn to use key'\n  }\n])\n```\n\nThen you sort them alphabetically. When updating the DOM, Vue will optimize rendering to perform the cheapest DOM mutations possible. That might mean deleting the first todo element, then adding it again at the end of the list.\n\nThe problem is, there are cases where it's important not to delete elements that will remain in the DOM. For example, you may want to use `<transition-group>` to animate list sorting, or maintain focus if the rendered element is an `<input>`. In these cases, adding a unique key for each item (e.g. `:key=\"todo.id\"`) will tell Vue how to behave more predictably.\n\nIn our experience, it's better to *always* add a unique key, so that you and your team simply never have to worry about these edge cases. Then in the rare, performance-critical scenarios where object constancy isn't necessary, you can make a conscious exception.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li v-for=\"todo in todos\">\n    {{ todo.text }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li\n    v-for=\"todo in todos\"\n    :key=\"todo.id\"\n  >\n    {{ todo.text }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n## Avoid `v-if` with `v-for`\n\n**Never use `v-if` on the same element as `v-for`.**\n\nThere are two common cases where this can be tempting:\n\n- To filter items in a list (e.g. `v-for=\"user in users\" v-if=\"user.isActive\"`). In these cases, replace `users` with a new computed property that returns your filtered list (e.g. `activeUsers`).\n\n- To avoid rendering a list if it should be hidden (e.g. `v-for=\"user in users\" v-if=\"shouldShowUsers\"`). In these cases, move the `v-if` to a container element (e.g. `ul`, `ol`).\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nWhen Vue processes directives, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`, so that this template:\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li\n    v-for=\"user in users\"\n    v-if=\"user.isActive\"\n    :key=\"user.id\"\n  >\n    {{ user.name }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nWill throw an error, because the `v-if` directive will be evaluated first and the iteration variable `user` does not exist at this moment.\n\nThis could be fixed by iterating over a computed property instead, like this:\n\n``` js\ncomputed: {\n  activeUsers() {\n    return this.users.filter(user => user.isActive)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst activeUsers = computed(() => {\n  return users.filter((user) => user.isActive)\n})\n```\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li\n    v-for=\"user in activeUsers\"\n    :key=\"user.id\"\n  >\n    {{ user.name }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use a `<template>` tag with `v-for` to wrap the `<li>` element:\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <template v-for=\"user in users\" :key=\"user.id\">\n    <li v-if=\"user.isActive\">\n      {{ user.name }}\n    </li>\n  </template>\n</ul>\n```\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li\n    v-for=\"user in users\"\n    v-if=\"user.isActive\"\n    :key=\"user.id\"\n  >\n    {{ user.name }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <li\n    v-for=\"user in activeUsers\"\n    :key=\"user.id\"\n  >\n    {{ user.name }}\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n``` template\n<ul>\n  <template v-for=\"user in users\" :key=\"user.id\">\n    <li v-if=\"user.isActive\">\n      {{ user.name }}\n    </li>\n  </template>\n</ul>\n```\n\n## Use component-scoped styling\n\nFor applications, styles in a top-level `App` component and in layout components may be global, but all other components should always be scoped.\n\nThis is only relevant for [Single-File Components](../guide/scaling-up/sfc). It does *not* require that the [`scoped` attribute](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/scoped-css.html) be used. Scoping could be through [CSS modules](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/css-modules), a class-based strategy such as [BEM](http://getbem.com/), or another library/convention.\n\n**Component libraries, however, should prefer a class-based strategy instead of using the `scoped` attribute.**\n\nThis makes overriding internal styles easier, with human-readable class names that don't have too high specificity, but are still very unlikely to result in a conflict.\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nIf you are developing a large project, working with other developers, or sometimes include 3rd-party HTML/CSS (e.g. from Auth0), consistent scoping will ensure that your styles only apply to the components they are meant for.\n\nBeyond the `scoped` attribute, using unique class names can help ensure that 3rd-party CSS does not apply to your own HTML. For example, many projects use the `button`, `btn`, or `icon` class names, so even if not using a strategy such as BEM, adding an app-specific and/or component-specific prefix (e.g. `ButtonClose-icon`) can provide some protection.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button class=\"btn btn-close\">×</button>\n</template>\n\n<style>\n.btn-close {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button class=\"button button-close\">×</button>\n</template>\n\n<!-- Using the `scoped` attribute -->\n<style scoped>\n.button {\n  border: none;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n}\n\n.button-close {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button :class=\"[$style.button, $style.buttonClose]\">×</button>\n</template>\n\n<!-- Using CSS modules -->\n<style module>\n.button {\n  border: none;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n}\n\n.buttonClose {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button class=\"c-Button c-Button--close\">×</button>\n</template>\n\n<!-- Using the BEM convention -->\n<style>\n.c-Button {\n  border: none;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n}\n\n.c-Button--close {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-essential](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-essential)"

  id: style-guide/rules-strongly-recommended
  summary: These rules have been found to improve readability and/or developer experience in most projects
  description: "# Priority B Rules: Strongly Recommended\n\nThese rules have been found to improve readability and/or developer experience in most projects. Your code will still run if you violate them, but violations should be rare and well-justified.\n\n## Component files\n\n**Whenever a build system is available to concatenate files, each component should be in its own file.**\n\nThis helps you to more quickly find a component when you need to edit it or review how to use it.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` js\napp.component('TodoList', {\n  // ...\n})\n\napp.component('TodoItem', {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- TodoList.js\n|- TodoItem.js\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- TodoList.vue\n|- TodoItem.vue\n```\n\n## Single-file component filename casing\n\n**Filenames of [Single-File Components](../guide/scaling-up/sfc) should either be always PascalCase or always kebab-case.**\n\nPascalCase works best with autocompletion in code editors, as it's consistent with how we reference components in JS(X) and templates, wherever possible. However, mixed case filenames can sometimes create issues on case-insensitive file systems, which is why kebab-case is also perfectly acceptable.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- mycomponent.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- myComponent.vue\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- MyComponent.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- my-component.vue\n```\n\n## Base component names\n\n**Base components (a.k.a. presentational, dumb, or pure components) that apply app-specific styling and conventions should all begin with a specific prefix, such as `Base`, `App`, or `V`.**\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nThese components lay the foundation for consistent styling and behavior in your application. They may **only** contain:\n\n- HTML elements,\n- other base components, and\n- 3rd-party UI components.\n\nBut they'll **never** contain global state (e.g. from a [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) store).\n\nTheir names often include the name of an element they wrap (e.g. `BaseButton`, `BaseTable`), unless no element exists for their specific purpose (e.g. `BaseIcon`). If you build similar components for a more specific context, they will almost always consume these components (e.g. `BaseButton` may be used in `ButtonSubmit`).\n\nSome advantages of this convention:\n\n- When organized alphabetically in editors, your app's base components are all listed together, making them easier to identify.\n\n- Since component names should always be multi-word, this convention prevents you from having to choose an arbitrary prefix for simple component wrappers (e.g. `MyButton`, `VueButton`).\n\n- Since these components are so frequently used, you may want to simply make them global instead of importing them everywhere. A prefix makes this possible with Webpack:\n\n  ``` js\n  const requireComponent = require.context(\n    './src',\n    true,\n    /Base[A-Z]\\w+\\.(vue|js)$/\n  )\n  requireComponent.keys().forEach(function (fileName) {\n    let baseComponentConfig = requireComponent(fileName)\n    baseComponentConfig =\n      baseComponentConfig.default || baseComponentConfig\n    const baseComponentName =\n      baseComponentConfig.name ||\n      fileName.replace(/^.+\\//, '').replace(/\\.\\w+$/, '')\n    app.component(baseComponentName, baseComponentConfig)\n  })\n  ```\n\n### Bad\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- MyButton.vue\n|- VueTable.vue\n|- Icon.vue\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- BaseButton.vue\n|- BaseTable.vue\n|- BaseIcon.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- AppButton.vue\n|- AppTable.vue\n|- AppIcon.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- VButton.vue\n|- VTable.vue\n|- VIcon.vue\n```\n\n## Tightly coupled component names\n\n**Child components that are tightly coupled with their parent should include the parent component name as a prefix.**\n\nIf a component only makes sense in the context of a single parent component, that relationship should be evident in its name. Since editors typically organize files alphabetically, this also keeps these related files next to each other.\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nYou might be tempted to solve this problem by nesting child components in directories named after their parent. For example:\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- TodoList/\n   |- Item/\n      |- index.vue\n      |- Button.vue\n   |- index.vue\n```\n\nor:\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- TodoList/\n   |- Item/\n      |- Button.vue\n   |- Item.vue\n|- TodoList.vue\n```\n\nThis isn't recommended, as it results in:\n\n- Many files with similar names, making rapid file switching in code editors more difficult.\n- Many nested sub-directories, which increases the time it takes to browse components in an editor's sidebar.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- TodoList.vue\n|- TodoItem.vue\n|- TodoButton.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- SearchSidebar.vue\n|- NavigationForSearchSidebar.vue\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- TodoList.vue\n|- TodoListItem.vue\n|- TodoListItemButton.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- SearchSidebar.vue\n|- SearchSidebarNavigation.vue\n```\n\n## Order of words in component names\n\n**Component names should start with the highest-level (often most general) words and end with descriptive modifying words.**\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nYou may be wondering:\n\n> \"Why would we force component names to use less natural language?\"\n\nIn natural English, adjectives and other descriptors do typically appear before the nouns, while exceptions require connector words. For example:\n\n- Coffee *with* milk\n- Soup *of the* day\n- Visitor *to the* museum\n\nYou can definitely include these connector words in component names if you'd like, but the order is still important.\n\nAlso note that **what's considered \"highest-level\" will be contextual to your app**. For example, imagine an app with a search form. It may include components like this one:\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- ClearSearchButton.vue\n|- ExcludeFromSearchInput.vue\n|- LaunchOnStartupCheckbox.vue\n|- RunSearchButton.vue\n|- SearchInput.vue\n|- TermsCheckbox.vue\n```\n\nAs you might notice, it's quite difficult to see which components are specific to the search. Now let's rename the components according to the rule:\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- SearchButtonClear.vue\n|- SearchButtonRun.vue\n|- SearchInputExcludeGlob.vue\n|- SearchInputQuery.vue\n|- SettingsCheckboxLaunchOnStartup.vue\n|- SettingsCheckboxTerms.vue\n```\n\nSince editors typically organize files alphabetically, all the important relationships between components are now evident at a glance.\n\nYou might be tempted to solve this problem differently, nesting all the search components under a \"search\" directory, then all the settings components under a \"settings\" directory. We only recommend considering this approach in very large apps (e.g. 100+ components), for these reasons:\n\n- It generally takes more time to navigate through nested sub-directories, than scrolling through a single `components` directory.\n- Name conflicts (e.g. multiple `ButtonDelete.vue` components) make it more difficult to quickly navigate to a specific component in a code editor.\n- Refactoring becomes more difficult, because find-and-replace often isn't sufficient to update relative references to a moved component.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- ClearSearchButton.vue\n|- ExcludeFromSearchInput.vue\n|- LaunchOnStartupCheckbox.vue\n|- RunSearchButton.vue\n|- SearchInput.vue\n|- TermsCheckbox.vue\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- SearchButtonClear.vue\n|- SearchButtonRun.vue\n|- SearchInputQuery.vue\n|- SearchInputExcludeGlob.vue\n|- SettingsCheckboxTerms.vue\n|- SettingsCheckboxLaunchOnStartup.vue\n```\n\n## Self-closing components\n\n**Components with no content should be self-closing in [Single-File Components](../guide/scaling-up/sfc), string templates, and [JSX](../guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) - but never in in-DOM templates.**\n\nComponents that self-close communicate that they not only have no content, but are **meant** to have no content. It's the difference between a blank page in a book and one labeled \"This page intentionally left blank.\" Your code is also cleaner without the unnecessary closing tag.\n\nUnfortunately, HTML doesn't allow custom elements to be self-closing - only [official \"void\" elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/syntax.html#void-elements). That's why the strategy is only possible when Vue's template compiler can reach the template before the DOM, then serve the DOM spec-compliant HTML.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<!-- In Single-File Components, string templates, and JSX -->\n<MyComponent></MyComponent>\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- In in-DOM templates -->\n<my-component/>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<!-- In Single-File Components, string templates, and JSX -->\n<MyComponent/>\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- In in-DOM templates -->\n<my-component></my-component>\n```\n\n## Component name casing in templates\n\n**In most projects, component names should always be PascalCase in [Single-File Components](../guide/scaling-up/sfc) and string templates - but kebab-case in in-DOM templates.**\n\nPascalCase has a few advantages over kebab-case:\n\n- Editors can autocomplete component names in templates, because PascalCase is also used in JavaScript.\n- `<MyComponent>` is more visually distinct from a single-word HTML element than `<my-component>`, because there are two character differences (the two capitals), rather than just one (a hyphen).\n- If you use any non-Vue custom elements in your templates, such as a web component, PascalCase ensures that your Vue components remain distinctly visible.\n\nUnfortunately, due to HTML's case insensitivity, in-DOM templates must still use kebab-case.\n\nAlso note that if you've already invested heavily in kebab-case, consistency with HTML conventions and being able to use the same casing across all your projects may be more important than the advantages listed above. In those cases, **using kebab-case everywhere is also acceptable.**\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<!-- In Single-File Components and string templates -->\n<mycomponent/>\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- In Single-File Components and string templates -->\n<myComponent/>\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- In in-DOM templates -->\n<MyComponent></MyComponent>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<!-- In Single-File Components and string templates -->\n<MyComponent/>\n```\n\n``` template\n<!-- In in-DOM templates -->\n<my-component></my-component>\n```\n\nOR\n\n``` template\n<!-- Everywhere -->\n<my-component></my-component>\n```\n\n## Component name casing in JS/JSX\n\n**Component names in JS/[JSX](../guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) should always be PascalCase, though they may be kebab-case inside strings for simpler applications that only use global component registration through `app.component`.**\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nIn JavaScript, PascalCase is the convention for classes and prototype constructors - essentially, anything that can have distinct instances. Vue components also have instances, so it makes sense to also use PascalCase. As an added benefit, using PascalCase within JSX (and templates) allows readers of the code to more easily distinguish between components and HTML elements.\n\nHowever, for applications that use **only** global component definitions via `app.component`, we recommend kebab-case instead. The reasons are:\n\n- It's rare that global components are ever referenced in JavaScript, so following a convention for JavaScript makes less sense.\n- These applications always include many in-DOM templates, where [kebab-case **must** be used](#component-name-casing-in-templates).\n\n### Bad\n\n``` js\napp.component('myComponent', {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n``` js\nimport myComponent from './MyComponent.vue'\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  name: 'myComponent'\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  name: 'my-component'\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` js\napp.component('MyComponent', {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n``` js\napp.component('my-component', {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n``` js\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'\n```\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  name: 'MyComponent'\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Full-word component names\n\n**Component names should prefer full words over abbreviations.**\n\nThe autocompletion in editors make the cost of writing longer names very low, while the clarity they provide is invaluable. Uncommon abbreviations, in particular, should always be avoided.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- SdSettings.vue\n|- UProfOpts.vue\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- StudentDashboardSettings.vue\n|- UserProfileOptions.vue\n```\n\n## Prop name casing\n\n**Prop names should always use camelCase during declaration. When used inside in-DOM templates, props should be kebab-cased. Single-File Components templates and [JSX](../guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) can use either kebab-case or camelCase props. Casing should be consistent - if you choose to use camelCased props, make sure you don't use kebab-cased ones in your application**\n\n### Bad\n\n``` js\nprops: {\n  'greeting-text': String\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst props = defineProps({\n  'greeting-text': String\n})\n```\n\n``` template\n// for in-DOM templates\n<welcome-message greetingText=\"hi\"></welcome-message>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` js\nprops: {\n  greetingText: String\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst props = defineProps({\n  greetingText: String\n})\n```\n\n``` template\n// for SFC - please make sure your casing is consistent throughout the project\n// you can use either convention but we don't recommend mixing two different casing styles\n<WelcomeMessage greeting-text=\"hi\"/>\n// or\n<WelcomeMessage greetingText=\"hi\"/>\n```\n\n``` template\n// for in-DOM templates\n<welcome-message greeting-text=\"hi\"></welcome-message>\n```\n\n## Multi-attribute elements\n\n**Elements with multiple attributes should span multiple lines, with one attribute per line.**\n\nIn JavaScript, splitting objects with multiple properties over multiple lines is widely considered a good convention, because it's much easier to read. Our templates and [JSX](../guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) deserve the same consideration.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<img src=\"https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png\" alt=\"Vue Logo\">\n```\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent foo=\"a\" bar=\"b\" baz=\"c\"/>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<img\n  src=\"https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png\"\n  alt=\"Vue Logo\"\n>\n```\n\n``` template\n<MyComponent\n  foo=\"a\"\n  bar=\"b\"\n  baz=\"c\"\n/>\n```\n\n## Simple expressions in templates\n\n**Component templates should only include simple expressions, with more complex expressions refactored into computed properties or methods.**\n\nComplex expressions in your templates make them less declarative. We should strive to describe *what* should appear, not *how* we're computing that value. Computed properties and methods also allow the code to be reused.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n{{\n  fullName.split(' ').map((word) => {\n    return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)\n  }).join(' ')\n}}\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<!-- In a template -->\n{{ normalizedFullName }}\n```\n\n``` js\n// The complex expression has been moved to a computed property\ncomputed: {\n  normalizedFullName() {\n    return this.fullName.split(' ')\n      .map(word => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))\n      .join(' ')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// The complex expression has been moved to a computed property\nconst normalizedFullName = computed(() =>\n  fullName.value\n    .split(' ')\n    .map((word) => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))\n    .join(' ')\n)\n```\n\n## Simple computed properties\n\n**Complex computed properties should be split into as many simpler properties as possible.**\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nSimpler, well-named computed properties are:\n\n- **Easier to test**\n\n  When each computed property contains only a very simple expression, with very few dependencies, it's much easier to write tests confirming that it works correctly.\n\n- **Easier to read**\n\n  Simplifying computed properties forces you to give each value a descriptive name, even if it's not reused. This makes it much easier for other developers (and future you) to focus in on the code they care about and figure out what's going on.\n\n- **More adaptable to changing requirements**\n\n  Any value that can be named might be useful to the view. For example, we might decide to display a message telling the user how much money they saved. We might also decide to calculate sales tax, but perhaps display it separately, rather than as part of the final price.\n\n  Small, focused computed properties make fewer assumptions about how information will be used, so require less refactoring as requirements change.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` js\ncomputed: {\n  price() {\n    const basePrice = this.manufactureCost / (1 - this.profitMargin)\n    return (\n      basePrice -\n      basePrice * (this.discountPercent || 0)\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst price = computed(() => {\n  const basePrice = manufactureCost.value / (1 - profitMargin.value)\n  return basePrice - basePrice * (discountPercent.value || 0)\n})\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` js\ncomputed: {\n  basePrice() {\n    return this.manufactureCost / (1 - this.profitMargin)\n  },\n\n  discount() {\n    return this.basePrice * (this.discountPercent || 0)\n  },\n\n  finalPrice() {\n    return this.basePrice - this.discount\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nconst basePrice = computed(\n  () => manufactureCost.value / (1 - profitMargin.value)\n)\n\nconst discount = computed(\n  () => basePrice.value * (discountPercent.value || 0)\n)\n\nconst finalPrice = computed(() => basePrice.value - discount.value)\n```\n\n## Quoted attribute values\n\n**Non-empty HTML attribute values should always be inside quotes (single or double, whichever is not used in JS).**\n\nWhile attribute values without any spaces are not required to have quotes in HTML, this practice often leads to *avoiding* spaces, making attribute values less readable.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<input type=text>\n```\n\n``` template\n<AppSidebar :style={width:sidebarWidth+'px'}>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<input type=\"text\">\n```\n\n``` template\n<AppSidebar :style=\"{ width: sidebarWidth + 'px' }\">\n```\n\n## Directive shorthands\n\n**Directive shorthands (`:` for `v-bind:`, `@` for `v-on:` and `#` for `v-slot`) should be used always or never.**\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<input\n  v-bind:value=\"newTodoText\"\n  :placeholder=\"newTodoInstructions\"\n>\n```\n\n``` template\n<input\n  v-on:input=\"onInput\"\n  @focus=\"onFocus\"\n>\n```\n\n``` template\n<template v-slot:header>\n  <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>\n</template>\n\n<template #footer>\n  <p>Here's some contact info</p>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<input\n  :value=\"newTodoText\"\n  :placeholder=\"newTodoInstructions\"\n>\n```\n\n``` template\n<input\n  v-bind:value=\"newTodoText\"\n  v-bind:placeholder=\"newTodoInstructions\"\n>\n```\n\n``` template\n<input\n  @input=\"onInput\"\n  @focus=\"onFocus\"\n>\n```\n\n``` template\n<input\n  v-on:input=\"onInput\"\n  v-on:focus=\"onFocus\"\n>\n```\n\n``` template\n<template v-slot:header>\n  <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>\n</template>\n\n<template v-slot:footer>\n  <p>Here's some contact info</p>\n</template>\n```\n\n``` template\n<template #header>\n  <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>\n</template>\n\n<template #footer>\n  <p>Here's some contact info</p>\n</template>\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-strongly-recommended](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-strongly-recommended)"

  summary: Some features of Vue exist to accommodate rare edge cases or smoother migrations from a legacy code base
  description: "# Priority D Rules: Use with Caution\n\nSome features of Vue exist to accommodate rare edge cases or smoother migrations from a legacy code base. When overused however, they can make your code more difficult to maintain or even become a source of bugs. These rules shine a light on potentially risky features, describing when and why they should be avoided.\n\n## Element selectors with `scoped`\n\n**Element selectors should be avoided with `scoped`.**\n\nPrefer class selectors over element selectors in `scoped` styles, because large numbers of element selectors are slow.\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nTo scope styles, Vue adds a unique attribute to component elements, such as `data-v-f3f3eg9`. Then selectors are modified so that only matching elements with this attribute are selected (e.g. `button[data-v-f3f3eg9]`).\n\nThe problem is that large numbers of element-attribute selectors (e.g. `button[data-v-f3f3eg9]`) will be considerably slower than class-attribute selectors (e.g. `.btn-close[data-v-f3f3eg9]`), so class selectors should be preferred whenever possible.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button>×</button>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\nbutton {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` template\n<template>\n  <button class=\"btn btn-close\">×</button>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n.btn-close {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n## Implicit parent-child communication\n\n**Props and events should be preferred for parent-child component communication, instead of `this.$parent` or mutating props.**\n\nAn ideal Vue application is props down, events up. Sticking to this convention makes your components much easier to understand. However, there are edge cases where prop mutation or `this.$parent` can simplify two components that are already deeply coupled.\n\nThe problem is, there are also many *simple* cases where these patterns may offer convenience. Beware: do not be seduced into trading simplicity (being able to understand the flow of your state) for short-term convenience (writing less code).\n\n### Bad\n\n``` js\napp.component('TodoItem', {\n  props: {\n    todo: {\n      type: Object,\n      required: true\n    }\n  },\n\n  template: '<input v-model=\"todo.text\">'\n})\n```\n\n``` js\napp.component('TodoItem', {\n  props: {\n    todo: {\n      type: Object,\n      required: true\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    removeTodo() {\n      this.$parent.todos = this.$parent.todos.filter(\n        (todo) => todo.id !== vm.todo.id\n      )\n    }\n  },\n\n  template: `\n    <span>\n      {{ todo.text }}\n      <button @click=\"removeTodo\">\n        ×\n      </button>\n    </span>\n  `\n})\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` js\napp.component('TodoItem', {\n  props: {\n    todo: {\n      type: Object,\n      required: true\n    }\n  },\n\n  emits: ['input'],\n\n  template: `\n    <input\n      :value=\"todo.text\"\n      @input=\"$emit('input', $event.target.value)\"\n    >\n  `\n})\n```\n\n``` js\napp.component('TodoItem', {\n  props: {\n    todo: {\n      type: Object,\n      required: true\n    }\n  },\n\n  emits: ['delete'],\n\n  template: `\n    <span>\n      {{ todo.text }}\n      <button @click=\"$emit('delete')\">\n        ×\n      </button>\n    </span>\n  `\n})\n```\n\n### Bad\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\ndefineProps({\n  todo: {\n    type: Object,\n    required: true\n  }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input v-model=\"todo.text\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { getCurrentInstance } from 'vue'\n\nconst props = defineProps({\n  todo: {\n    type: Object,\n    required: true\n  }\n})\n\nconst instance = getCurrentInstance()\n\nfunction removeTodo() {\n  const parent = instance.parent\n  if (!parent) return\n\n  parent.props.todos = parent.props.todos.filter((todo) => {\n    return todo.id !== props.todo.id\n  })\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <span>\n    {{ todo.text }}\n    <button @click=\"removeTodo\">×</button>\n  </span>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\ndefineProps({\n  todo: {\n    type: Object,\n    required: true\n  }\n})\n\nconst emit = defineEmits(['input'])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <input :value=\"todo.text\" @input=\"emit('input', $event.target.value)\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\ndefineProps({\n  todo: {\n    type: Object,\n    required: true\n  }\n})\n\nconst emit = defineEmits(['delete'])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <span>\n    {{ todo.text }}\n    <button @click=\"emit('delete')\">×</button>\n  </span>\n</template>\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-use-with-caution](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-use-with-caution)"

  summary: Shallow version of ref()
  description: "# Reactivity API: Advanced\n\n## shallowRef()\n\nShallow version of [`ref()`](reactivity-core#ref).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function shallowRef<T>(value: T): ShallowRef<T>\n\n  interface ShallowRef<T> {\n    value: T\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Unlike `ref()`, the inner value of a shallow ref is stored and exposed as-is, and will not be made deeply reactive. Only the `.value` access is reactive.\n\n  `shallowRef()` is typically used for performance optimizations of large data structures, or integration with external state management systems.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = shallowRef({ count: 1 })\n\n  // does NOT trigger change\n  state.value.count = 2\n\n  // does trigger change\n  state.value = { count: 2 }\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Reduce Reactivity Overhead for Large Immutable Structures](../guide/best-practices/performance#reduce-reactivity-overhead-for-large-immutable-structures)\n  - [Guide - Integration with External State Systems](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#integration-with-external-state-systems)\n\n## triggerRef()\n\nForce trigger effects that depends on a [shallow ref](#shallowref). This is typically used after making deep mutations to the inner value of a shallow ref.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function triggerRef(ref: ShallowRef): void\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const shallow = shallowRef({\n    greet: 'Hello, world'\n  })\n\n  // Logs \"Hello, world\" once for the first run-through\n  watchEffect(() => {\n    console.log(shallow.value.greet)\n  })\n\n  // This won't trigger the effect because the ref is shallow\n  shallow.value.greet = 'Hello, universe'\n\n  // Logs \"Hello, universe\"\n  triggerRef(shallow)\n  ```\n\n## customRef()\n\nCreates a customized ref with explicit control over its dependency tracking and updates triggering.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function customRef<T>(factory: CustomRefFactory<T>): Ref<T>\n\n  type CustomRefFactory<T> = (\n    track: () => void,\n    trigger: () => void\n  ) => {\n    get: () => T\n    set: (value: T) => void\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `customRef()` expects a factory function, which receives `track` and `trigger` functions as arguments and should return an object with `get` and `set` methods.\n\n  In general, `track()` should be called inside `get()`, and `trigger()` should be called inside `set()`. However, you have full control over when they should be called, or whether they should be called at all.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Creating a debounced ref that only updates the value after a certain timeout after the latest set call:\n\n  ``` js\n  import { customRef } from 'vue'\n\n  export function useDebouncedRef(value, delay = 200) {\n    let timeout\n    return customRef((track, trigger) => {\n      return {\n        get() {\n          track()\n          return value\n        },\n        set(newValue) {\n          clearTimeout(timeout)\n          timeout = setTimeout(() => {\n            value = newValue\n            trigger()\n          }, delay)\n        }\n      }\n    })\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Usage in component:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { useDebouncedRef } from './debouncedRef'\n  const text = useDebouncedRef('hello')\n  </script>\n\n  <template>\n    <input v-model=\"text\" />\n  </template>\n  ```\n\n  [Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNplUkFugzAQ/MqKC1SiIekxIpEq9QVV1BMXCguhBdsyaxqE/PcuGAhNfYGd3Z0ZDwzeq1K7zqB39OI205UiaJGMOieiapTUBAOYFt/wUxqRYf6OBVgotGzA30X5Bt59tX4iMilaAsIbwelxMfCvWNfSD+Gw3++fEhFHTpLFuCBsVJ0ScgUQjw6Az+VatY5PiroHo3IeaeHANlkrh7Qg1NBL43cILUmlMAfqVSXK40QUOSYmHAZHZO0KVkIZgu65kTnWp8Qb+4kHEXfjaDXkhd7DTTmuNZ7MsGyzDYbz5CgSgbdppOBFqqT4l0eX1gZDYOm057heOBQYRl81coZVg9LQWGr+IlrchYKAdJp9h0C6KkvUT3A6u8V1dq4ASqRgZnVnWg04/QWYNyYzC2rD5Y3/hkDgz8fY/cOT1ZjqizMZzGY3rDPC12KGZYyd3J26M8ny1KKx7c3X25q1c1wrZN3L9LCMWs/+AmeG6xI=)\n\n## shallowReactive()\n\nShallow version of [`reactive()`](reactivity-core#reactive).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function shallowReactive<T extends object>(target: T): T\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Unlike `reactive()`, there is no deep conversion: only root-level properties are reactive for a shallow reactive object. Property values are stored and exposed as-is - this also means properties with ref values will **not** be automatically unwrapped.\n\n  **Use with Caution**\n  Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component. Avoid nesting it inside a deep reactive object as it creates a tree with inconsistent reactivity behavior which can be difficult to understand and debug.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = shallowReactive({\n    foo: 1,\n    nested: {\n      bar: 2\n    }\n  })\n\n  // mutating state's own properties is reactive\n  state.foo++\n\n  // ...but does not convert nested objects\n  isReactive(state.nested) // false\n\n  // NOT reactive\n  state.nested.bar++\n  ```\n\n## shallowReadonly()\n\nShallow version of [`readonly()`](reactivity-core#readonly).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function shallowReadonly<T extends object>(target: T): Readonly<T>\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Unlike `readonly()`, there is no deep conversion: only root-level properties are made readonly. Property values are stored and exposed as-is - this also means properties with ref values will **not** be automatically unwrapped.\n\n  **Use with Caution**\n  Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component. Avoid nesting it inside a deep reactive object as it creates a tree with inconsistent reactivity behavior which can be difficult to understand and debug.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = shallowReadonly({\n    foo: 1,\n    nested: {\n      bar: 2\n    }\n  })\n\n  // mutating state's own properties will fail\n  state.foo++\n\n  // ...but works on nested objects\n  isReadonly(state.nested) // false\n\n  // works\n  state.nested.bar++\n  ```\n\n## toRaw()\n\nReturns the raw, original object of a Vue-created proxy.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function toRaw<T>(proxy: T): T\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `toRaw()` can return the original object from proxies created by [`reactive()`](reactivity-core#reactive), [`readonly()`](reactivity-core#readonly), [`shallowReactive()`](#shallowreactive) or [`shallowReadonly()`](#shallowreadonly).\n\n  This is an escape hatch that can be used to temporarily read without incurring proxy access / tracking overhead or write without triggering changes. It is **not** recommended to hold a persistent reference to the original object. Use with caution.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const foo = {}\n  const reactiveFoo = reactive(foo)\n\n  console.log(toRaw(reactiveFoo) === foo) // true\n  ```\n\n## markRaw()\n\nMarks an object so that it will never be converted to a proxy. Returns the object itself.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function markRaw<T extends object>(value: T): T\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const foo = markRaw({})\n  console.log(isReactive(reactive(foo))) // false\n\n  // also works when nested inside other reactive objects\n  const bar = reactive({ foo })\n  console.log(isReactive(bar.foo)) // false\n  ```\n\n  **Use with Caution**\n  `markRaw()` and shallow APIs such as `shallowReactive()` allow you to selectively opt-out of the default deep reactive/readonly conversion and embed raw, non-proxied objects in your state graph. They can be used for various reasons:\n\n  - Some values simply should not be made reactive, for example a complex 3rd party class instance, or a Vue component object.\n\n  - Skipping proxy conversion can provide performance improvements when rendering large lists with immutable data sources.\n\n  They are considered advanced because the raw opt-out is only at the root level, so if you set a nested, non-marked raw object into a reactive object and then access it again, you get the proxied version back. This can lead to **identity hazards** - i.e. performing an operation that relies on object identity but using both the raw and the proxied version of the same object:\n\n  ``` js\n  const foo = markRaw({\n    nested: {}\n  })\n\n  const bar = reactive({\n    // although `foo` is marked as raw, foo.nested is not.\n    nested: foo.nested\n  })\n\n  console.log(foo.nested === bar.nested) // false\n  ```\n\n  Identity hazards are in general rare. However, to properly utilize these APIs while safely avoiding identity hazards requires a solid understanding of how the reactivity system works.\n\n## effectScope()\n\nCreates an effect scope object which can capture the reactive effects (i.e. computed and watchers) created within it so that these effects can be disposed together. For detailed use cases of this API, please consult its corresponding [RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0041-reactivity-effect-scope.md).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function effectScope(detached?: boolean): EffectScope\n\n  interface EffectScope {\n    run<T>(fn: () => T): T | undefined // undefined if scope is inactive\n    stop(): void\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const scope = effectScope()\n\n  scope.run(() => {\n    const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)\n\n    watch(doubled, () => console.log(doubled.value))\n\n    watchEffect(() => console.log('Count: ', doubled.value))\n  })\n\n  // to dispose all effects in the scope\n  scope.stop()\n  ```\n\n## getCurrentScope()\n\nReturns the current active [effect scope](#effectscope) if there is one.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function getCurrentScope(): EffectScope | undefined\n  ```\n\n## onScopeDispose()\n\nRegisters a dispose callback on the current active [effect scope](#effectscope). The callback will be invoked when the associated effect scope is stopped.\n\nThis method can be used as a non-component-coupled replacement of `onUnmounted` in reusable composition functions, since each Vue component's `setup()` function is also invoked in an effect scope.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function onScopeDispose(fn: () => void): void\n  ```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-advanced](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-advanced)"

  summary: Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property .value that points to the inner value
  description: "# Reactivity API: Core\n\n**See also**\n\nTo better understand the Reactivity APIs, it is recommended to read the following chapters in the guide:\n\n- [Reactivity Fundamentals](../guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals) (with the API preference set to Composition API)\n- [Reactivity in Depth](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth)\n\n## ref()\n\nTakes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property `.value` that points to the inner value.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function ref<T>(value: T): Ref<UnwrapRef<T>>\n\n  interface Ref<T> {\n    value: T\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The ref object is mutable - i.e. you can assign new values to `.value`. It is also reactive - i.e. any read operations to `.value` are tracked, and write operations will trigger associated effects.\n\n  If an object is assigned as a ref's value, the object is made deeply reactive with [reactive()](#reactive). This also means if the object contains nested refs, they will be deeply unwrapped.\n\n  To avoid the deep conversion, use [`shallowRef()`](reactivity-advanced#shallowref) instead.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const count = ref(0)\n  console.log(count.value) // 0\n\n  count.value = 1\n  console.log(count.value) // 1\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Reactivity Fundamentals with `ref()`](../guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals#ref)\n  - [Guide - Typing `ref()`](../guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-ref)\n\n## computed()\n\nTakes a getter function and returns a readonly reactive [ref](#ref) object for the returned value from the getter. It can also take an object with `get` and `set` functions to create a writable ref object.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  // read-only\n  function computed<T>(\n    getter: (oldValue: T | undefined) => T,\n    // see \"Computed Debugging\" link below\n    debuggerOptions?: DebuggerOptions\n  ): Readonly<Ref<Readonly<T>>>\n\n  // writable\n  function computed<T>(\n    options: {\n      get: (oldValue: T | undefined) => T\n      set: (value: T) => void\n    },\n    debuggerOptions?: DebuggerOptions\n  ): Ref<T>\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Creating a readonly computed ref:\n\n  ``` js\n  const count = ref(1)\n  const plusOne = computed(() => count.value + 1)\n\n  console.log(plusOne.value) // 2\n\n  plusOne.value++ // error\n  ```\n\n  Creating a writable computed ref:\n\n  ``` js\n  const count = ref(1)\n  const plusOne = computed({\n    get: () => count.value + 1,\n    set: (val) => {\n      count.value = val - 1\n    }\n  })\n\n  plusOne.value = 1\n  console.log(count.value) // 0\n  ```\n\n  Debugging:\n\n  ``` js\n  const plusOne = computed(() => count.value + 1, {\n    onTrack(e) {\n      debugger\n    },\n    onTrigger(e) {\n      debugger\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Computed Properties](../guide/essentials/computed)\n  - [Guide - Computed Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#computed-debugging)\n  - [Guide - Typing `computed()`](../guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-computed)\n  - [Guide - Performance - Computed Stability](../guide/best-practices/performance#computed-stability)\n\n## reactive()\n\nReturns a reactive proxy of the object.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function reactive<T extends object>(target: T): UnwrapNestedRefs<T>\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The reactive conversion is \"deep\": it affects all nested properties. A reactive object also deeply unwraps any properties that are [refs](#ref) while maintaining reactivity.\n\n  It should also be noted that there is no ref unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`.\n\n  To avoid the deep conversion and only retain reactivity at the root level, use [shallowReactive()](reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) instead.\n\n  The returned object and its nested objects are wrapped with [ES Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and **not** equal to the original objects. It is recommended to work exclusively with the reactive proxy and avoid relying on the original object.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Creating a reactive object:\n\n  ``` js\n  const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })\n  obj.count++\n  ```\n\n  Ref unwrapping:\n\n  ``` ts\n  const count = ref(1)\n  const obj = reactive({ count })\n\n  // ref will be unwrapped\n  console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true\n\n  // it will update `obj.count`\n  count.value++\n  console.log(count.value) // 2\n  console.log(obj.count) // 2\n\n  // it will also update `count` ref\n  obj.count++\n  console.log(obj.count) // 3\n  console.log(count.value) // 3\n  ```\n\n  Note that refs are **not** unwrapped when accessed as array or collection elements:\n\n  ``` js\n  const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])\n  // need .value here\n  console.log(books[0].value)\n\n  const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))\n  // need .value here\n  console.log(map.get('count').value)\n  ```\n\n  When assigning a [ref](#ref) to a `reactive` property, that ref will also be automatically unwrapped:\n\n  ``` ts\n  const count = ref(1)\n  const obj = reactive({})\n\n  obj.count = count\n\n  console.log(obj.count) // 1\n  console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Reactivity Fundamentals](../guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals)\n  - [Guide - Typing `reactive()`](../guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-reactive)\n\n## readonly()\n\nTakes an object (reactive or plain) or a [ref](#ref) and returns a readonly proxy to the original.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function readonly<T extends object>(\n    target: T\n  ): DeepReadonly<UnwrapNestedRefs<T>>\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  A readonly proxy is deep: any nested property accessed will be readonly as well. It also has the same ref-unwrapping behavior as `reactive()`, except the unwrapped values will also be made readonly.\n\n  To avoid the deep conversion, use [shallowReadonly()](reactivity-advanced#shallowreadonly) instead.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const original = reactive({ count: 0 })\n\n  const copy = readonly(original)\n\n  watchEffect(() => {\n    // works for reactivity tracking\n    console.log(copy.count)\n  })\n\n  // mutating original will trigger watchers relying on the copy\n  original.count++\n\n  // mutating the copy will fail and result in a warning\n  copy.count++ // warning!\n  ```\n\n## watchEffect()\n\nRuns a function immediately while reactively tracking its dependencies and re-runs it whenever the dependencies are changed.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function watchEffect(\n    effect: (onCleanup: OnCleanup) => void,\n    options?: WatchEffectOptions\n  ): StopHandle\n\n  type OnCleanup = (cleanupFn: () => void) => void\n\n  interface WatchEffectOptions {\n    flush?: 'pre' | 'post' | 'sync' // default: 'pre'\n    onTrack?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void\n    onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void\n  }\n\n  type StopHandle = () => void\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The first argument is the effect function to be run. The effect function receives a function that can be used to register a cleanup callback. The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request (see example below).\n\n  The second argument is an optional options object that can be used to adjust the effect's flush timing or to debug the effect's dependencies.\n\n  By default, watchers will run just prior to component rendering. Setting `flush: 'post'` will defer the watcher until after component rendering. See [Callback Flush Timing](../guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) for more information. In rare cases, it might be necessary to trigger a watcher immediately when a reactive dependency changes, e.g. to invalidate a cache. This can be achieved using `flush: 'sync'`. However, this setting should be used with caution, as it can lead to problems with performance and data consistency if multiple properties are being updated at the same time.\n\n  The return value is a handle function that can be called to stop the effect from running again.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const count = ref(0)\n\n  watchEffect(() => console.log(count.value))\n  // -> logs 0\n\n  count.value++\n  // -> logs 1\n  ```\n\n  Side effect cleanup:\n\n  ``` js\n  watchEffect(async (onCleanup) => {\n    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(id.value)\n    // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes\n    // so that previous pending request will be cancelled\n    // if not yet completed\n    onCleanup(cancel)\n    data.value = await response\n  })\n  ```\n\n  Stopping the watcher:\n\n  ``` js\n  const stop = watchEffect(() => {})\n\n  // when the watcher is no longer needed:\n  stop()\n  ```\n\n  Options:\n\n  ``` js\n  watchEffect(() => {}, {\n    flush: 'post',\n    onTrack(e) {\n      debugger\n    },\n    onTrigger(e) {\n      debugger\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers#watcheffect)\n  - [Guide - Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging)\n\n## watchPostEffect()\n\nAlias of [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect) with `flush: 'post'` option.\n\n## watchSyncEffect()\n\nAlias of [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect) with `flush: 'sync'` option.\n\n## watch()\n\nWatches one or more reactive data sources and invokes a callback function when the sources change.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  // watching single source\n  function watch<T>(\n    source: WatchSource<T>,\n    callback: WatchCallback<T>,\n    options?: WatchOptions\n  ): StopHandle\n\n  // watching multiple sources\n  function watch<T>(\n    sources: WatchSource<T>[],\n    callback: WatchCallback<T[]>,\n    options?: WatchOptions\n  ): StopHandle\n\n  type WatchCallback<T> = (\n    value: T,\n    oldValue: T,\n    onCleanup: (cleanupFn: () => void) => void\n  ) => void\n\n  type WatchSource<T> =\n    | Ref<T> // ref\n    | (() => T) // getter\n    | T extends object\n    ? T\n    : never // reactive object\n\n  interface WatchOptions extends WatchEffectOptions {\n    immediate?: boolean // default: false\n    deep?: boolean // default: false\n    flush?: 'pre' | 'post' | 'sync' // default: 'pre'\n    onTrack?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void\n    onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void\n    once?: boolean // default: false (3.4+)\n  }\n  ```\n\n  > Types are simplified for readability.\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `watch()` is lazy by default - i.e. the callback is only called when the watched source has changed.\n\n  The first argument is the watcher's **source**. The source can be one of the following:\n\n  - A getter function that returns a value\n  - A ref\n  - A reactive object\n  - ...or an array of the above.\n\n  The second argument is the callback that will be called when the source changes. The callback receives three arguments: the new value, the old value, and a function for registering a side effect cleanup callback. The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request.\n\n  When watching multiple sources, the callback receives two arrays containing new / old values corresponding to the source array.\n\n  The third optional argument is an options object that supports the following options:\n\n  - **`immediate`**: trigger the callback immediately on watcher creation. Old value will be `undefined` on the first call.\n  - **`deep`**: force deep traversal of the source if it is an object, so that the callback fires on deep mutations. See [Deep Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers#deep-watchers).\n  - **`flush`**: adjust the callback's flush timing. See [Callback Flush Timing](../guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) and [`watchEffect()`](reactivity-core#watcheffect).\n  - **`onTrack / onTrigger`**: debug the watcher's dependencies. See [Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging).\n  - **`once`**: run the callback only once. The watcher is automatically stopped after the first callback run.\n\n  Compared to [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect), `watch()` allows us to:\n\n  - Perform the side effect lazily;\n  - Be more specific about what state should trigger the watcher to re-run;\n  - Access both the previous and current value of the watched state.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Watching a getter:\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n  watch(\n    () => state.count,\n    (count, prevCount) => {\n      /* ... */\n    }\n  )\n  ```\n\n  Watching a ref:\n\n  ``` js\n  const count = ref(0)\n  watch(count, (count, prevCount) => {\n    /* ... */\n  })\n  ```\n\n  When watching multiple sources, the callback receives arrays containing new / old values corresponding to the source array:\n\n  ``` js\n  watch([fooRef, barRef], ([foo, bar], [prevFoo, prevBar]) => {\n    /* ... */\n  })\n  ```\n\n  When using a getter source, the watcher only fires if the getter's return value has changed. If you want the callback to fire even on deep mutations, you need to explicitly force the watcher into deep mode with `{ deep: true }`. Note in deep mode, the new value and the old will be the same object if the callback was triggered by a deep mutation:\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n  watch(\n    () => state,\n    (newValue, oldValue) => {\n      // newValue === oldValue\n    },\n    { deep: true }\n  )\n  ```\n\n  When directly watching a reactive object, the watcher is automatically in deep mode:\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n  watch(state, () => {\n    /* triggers on deep mutation to state */\n  })\n  ```\n\n  `watch()` shares the same flush timing and debugging options with [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect):\n\n  ``` js\n  watch(source, callback, {\n    flush: 'post',\n    onTrack(e) {\n      debugger\n    },\n    onTrigger(e) {\n      debugger\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  Stopping the watcher:\n\n  ``` js\n  const stop = watch(source, callback)\n\n  // when the watcher is no longer needed:\n  stop()\n  ```\n\n  Side effect cleanup:\n\n  ``` js\n  watch(id, async (newId, oldId, onCleanup) => {\n    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(newId)\n    // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes, cancelling\n    // the previous request if it hasn't completed yet\n    onCleanup(cancel)\n    data.value = await response\n  })\n  ```\n\n- **See also**\n\n  - [Guide - Watchers](../guide/essentials/watchers)\n  - [Guide - Watcher Debugging](../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core)"

This is a sugar function for `val = isRef(val) ? val.value : val`.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function unref<T>(ref: T | Ref<T>): T\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function useFoo(x: number | Ref<number>) {\n    const unwrapped = unref(x)\n    // unwrapped is guaranteed to be number now\n  }\n  ```\n\n## toRef()\n\nCan be used to normalize values / refs / getters into refs (3.3+).\n\nCan also be used to create a ref for a property on a source reactive object. The created ref is synced with its source property: mutating the source property will update the ref, and vice-versa.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  // normalization signature (3.3+)\n  function toRef<T>(\n    value: T\n  ): T extends () => infer R\n    ? Readonly<Ref<R>>\n    : T extends Ref\n    ? T\n    : Ref<UnwrapRef<T>>\n\n  // object property signature\n  function toRef<T extends object, K extends keyof T>(\n    object: T,\n    key: K,\n    defaultValue?: T[K]\n  ): ToRef<T[K]>\n\n  type ToRef<T> = T extends Ref ? T : Ref<T>\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Normalization signature (3.3+):\n\n  ``` js\n  // returns existing refs as-is\n  toRef(existingRef)\n\n  // creates a readonly ref that calls the getter on .value access\n  toRef(() => props.foo)\n\n  // creates normal refs from non-function values\n  // equivalent to ref(1)\n  toRef(1)\n  ```\n\n  Object property signature:\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({\n    foo: 1,\n    bar: 2\n  })\n\n  // a two-way ref that syncs with the original property\n  const fooRef = toRef(state, 'foo')\n\n  // mutating the ref updates the original\n  fooRef.value++\n  console.log(state.foo) // 2\n\n  // mutating the original also updates the ref\n  state.foo++\n  console.log(fooRef.value) // 3\n  ```\n\n  Note this is different from:\n\n  ``` js\n  const fooRef = ref(state.foo)\n  ```\n\n  The above ref is **not** synced with `state.foo`, because the `ref()` receives a plain number value.\n\n  `toRef()` is useful when you want to pass the ref of a prop to a composable function:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  <script setup>\n  import { toRef } from 'vue'\n\n  const props = defineProps(/* ... */)\n\n  // convert `props.foo` into a ref, then pass into\n  // a composable\n  useSomeFeature(toRef(props, 'foo'))\n\n  // getter syntax - recommended in 3.3+\n  useSomeFeature(toRef(() => props.foo))\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  When `toRef` is used with component props, the usual restrictions around mutating the props still apply. Attempting to assign a new value to the ref is equivalent to trying to modify the prop directly and is not allowed. In that scenario you may want to consider using [`computed`](reactivity-core#computed) with `get` and `set` instead. See the guide to [using `v-model` with components](../guide/components/v-model) for more information.\n\n  When using the object property signature, `toRef()` will return a usable ref even if the source property doesn't currently exist. This makes it possible to work with optional properties, which wouldn't be picked up by [`toRefs`](#torefs).\n\n## toValue()\n\nNormalizes values / refs / getters to values. This is similar to [unref()](#unref), except that it also normalizes getters. If the argument is a getter, it will be invoked and its return value will be returned.\n\nThis can be used in [Composables](../guide/reusability/composables) to normalize an argument that can be either a value, a ref, or a getter.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function toValue<T>(source: T | Ref<T> | (() => T)): T\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  toValue(1) //       --> 1\n  toValue(ref(1)) //  --> 1\n  toValue(() => 1) // --> 1\n  ```\n\n  Normalizing arguments in composables:\n\n  ``` ts\n  import type { MaybeRefOrGetter } from 'vue'\n\n  function useFeature(id: MaybeRefOrGetter<number>) {\n    watch(() => toValue(id), id => {\n      // react to id changes\n    })\n  }\n\n  // this composable supports any of the following:\n  useFeature(1)\n  useFeature(ref(1))\n  useFeature(() => 1)\n  ```\n\n## toRefs()\n\nConverts a reactive object to a plain object where each property of the resulting object is a ref pointing to the corresponding property of the original object. Each individual ref is created using [`toRef()`](#toref).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function toRefs<T extends object>(\n    object: T\n  ): {\n    [K in keyof T]: ToRef<T[K]>\n  }\n\n  type ToRef = T extends Ref ? T : Ref<T>\n  ```\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  const state = reactive({\n    foo: 1,\n    bar: 2\n  })\n\n  const stateAsRefs = toRefs(state)\n  /*\n  Type of stateAsRefs: {\n    foo: Ref<number>,\n    bar: Ref<number>\n  }\n  */\n\n  // The ref and the original property is \"linked\"\n  state.foo++\n  console.log(stateAsRefs.foo.value) // 2\n\n  stateAsRefs.foo.value++\n  console.log(state.foo) // 3\n  ```\n\n  `toRefs` is useful when returning a reactive object from a composable function so that the consuming component can destructure/spread the returned object without losing reactivity:\n\n  ``` js\n  function useFeatureX() {\n    const state = reactive({\n      foo: 1,\n      bar: 2\n    })\n\n    // ...logic operating on state\n\n    // convert to refs when returning\n    return toRefs(state)\n  }\n\n  // can destructure without losing reactivity\n  const { foo, bar } = useFeatureX()\n  ```\n\n  `toRefs` will only generate refs for properties that are enumerable on the source object at call time. To create a ref for a property that may not exist yet, use [`toRef`](#toref) instead.\n\n## isProxy()\n\nChecks if an object is a proxy created by [`reactive()`](reactivity-core#reactive), [`readonly()`](reactivity-core#readonly), [`shallowReactive()`](reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) or [`shallowReadonly()`](reactivity-advanced#shallowreadonly).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function isProxy(value: unknown): boolean\n  ```\n\n## isReactive()\n\nChecks if an object is a proxy created by [`reactive()`](reactivity-core#reactive) or [`shallowReactive()`](reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function isReactive(value: unknown): boolean\n  ```\n\n## isReadonly()\n\nChecks whether the passed value is a readonly object. The properties of a readonly object can change, but they can't be assigned directly via the passed object.\n\nThe proxies created by [`readonly()`](reactivity-core#readonly) and [`shallowReadonly()`](reactivity-advanced#shallowreadonly) are both considered readonly, as is a [`computed()`](reactivity-core#computed) ref without a `set` function.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function isReadonly(value: unknown): boolean\n  ```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-utilities](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-utilities)"

  summary: Reactivity Transform was an experimental feature, and has been removed in the latest 3.4 release
  description: "# Reactivity Transform\n\n**Removed Experimental Feature**\n\nReactivity Transform was an experimental feature, and has been removed in the latest 3.4 release. Please read about [the reasoning here](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369#discussioncomment-5059028).\n\nIf you still intend to use it, it is now available via the [Vue Macros](https://vue-macros.sxzz.moe/features/reactivity-transform.html) plugin.\n\n**Composition-API-specific**\n\nReactivity Transform is a Composition-API-specific feature and requires a build step.\n\n## Refs vs. Reactive Variables\n\nEver since the introduction of the Composition API, one of the primary unresolved questions is the use of refs vs. reactive objects. It's easy to lose reactivity when destructuring reactive objects, while it can be cumbersome to use `.value` everywhere when using refs. Also, `.value` is easy to miss if not using a type system.\n\n[Vue Reactivity Transform](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity-transform) is a compile-time transform that allows us to write code like this:\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nlet count = $ref(0)\n\nconsole.log(count)\n\nfunction increment() {\n  count++\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">{{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\nThe `$ref()` method here is a **compile-time macro**: it is not an actual method that will be called at runtime. Instead, the Vue compiler uses it as a hint to treat the resulting `count` variable as a **reactive variable.**\n\nReactive variables can be accessed and re-assigned just like normal variables, but these operations are compiled into refs with `.value`. For example, the `<script>` part of the above component is compiled into:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nlet count = ref(0)\n\nconsole.log(count.value)\n\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}\n```\n\nEvery reactivity API that returns refs will have a `$`-prefixed macro equivalent. These APIs include:\n\n- [`ref`](../../api/reactivity-core#ref) -\\> `$ref`\n- [`computed`](../../api/reactivity-core#computed) -\\> `$computed`\n- [`shallowRef`](../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref) -\\> `$shallowRef`\n- [`customRef`](../../api/reactivity-advanced#customref) -\\> `$customRef`\n- [`toRef`](../../api/reactivity-utilities#toref) -\\> `$toRef`\n\nThese macros are globally available and do not need to be imported when Reactivity Transform is enabled, but you can optionally import them from `vue/macros` if you want to be more explicit:\n\n``` js\nimport { $ref } from 'vue/macros'\n\nlet count = $ref(0)\n```\n\n## Destructuring with `$()`\n\nIt is common for a composition function to return an object of refs, and use destructuring to retrieve these refs. For this purpose, reactivity transform provides the **`$()`** macro:\n\n``` js\nimport { useMouse } from '@vueuse/core'\n\nconst { x, y } = $(useMouse())\n\nconsole.log(x, y)\n```\n\nCompiled output:\n\n``` js\nimport { toRef } from 'vue'\nimport { useMouse } from '@vueuse/core'\n\nconst __temp = useMouse(),\n  x = toRef(__temp, 'x'),\n  y = toRef(__temp, 'y')\n\nconsole.log(x.value, y.value)\n```\n\nNote that if `x` is already a ref, `toRef(__temp, 'x')` will simply return it as-is and no additional ref will be created. If a destructured value is not a ref (e.g. a function), it will still work - the value will be wrapped in a ref so the rest of the code works as expected.\n\n`$()` destructure works on both reactive objects **and** plain objects containing refs.\n\n## Convert Existing Refs to Reactive Variables with `$()`\n\nIn some cases we may have wrapped functions that also return refs. However, the Vue compiler won't be able to know ahead of time that a function is going to return a ref. In such cases, the `$()` macro can also be used to convert any existing refs into reactive variables:\n\n``` js\nfunction myCreateRef() {\n  return ref(0)\n}\n\nlet count = $(myCreateRef())\n```\n\n## Reactive Props Destructure\n\nThere are two pain points with the current `defineProps()` usage in `<script setup>`:\n\n1.  Similar to `.value`, you need to always access props as `props.x` in order to retain reactivity. This means you cannot destructure `defineProps` because the resulting destructured variables are not reactive and will not update.\n\n2.  When using the [type-only props declaration](../../api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations), there is no easy way to declare default values for the props. We introduced the `withDefaults()` API for this exact purpose, but it's still clunky to use.\n\nWe can address these issues by applying a compile-time transform when `defineProps` is used with destructuring, similar to what we saw earlier with `$()`:\n\n``` html\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  interface Props {\n    msg: string\n    count?: number\n    foo?: string\n  }\n\n  const {\n    msg,\n    // default value just works\n    count = 1,\n    // local aliasing also just works\n    // here we are aliasing `props.foo` to `bar`\n    foo: bar\n  } = defineProps<Props>()\n\n  watchEffect(() => {\n    // will log whenever the props change\n    console.log(msg, count, bar)\n  })\n</script>\n```\n\nThe above will be compiled into the following runtime declaration equivalent:\n\n``` js\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    msg: { type: String, required: true },\n    count: { type: Number, default: 1 },\n    foo: String\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    watchEffect(() => {\n      console.log(props.msg, props.count, props.foo)\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Retaining Reactivity Across Function Boundaries\n\nWhile reactive variables relieve us from having to use `.value` everywhere, it creates an issue of \"reactivity loss\" when we pass reactive variables across function boundaries. This can happen in two cases:\n\n### Passing into function as argument\n\nGiven a function that expects a ref as an argument, e.g.:\n\n``` ts\nfunction trackChange(x: Ref<number>) {\n  watch(x, (x) => {\n    console.log('x changed!')\n  })\n}\n\nlet count = $ref(0)\ntrackChange(count) // doesn't work!\n```\n\nThe above case will not work as expected because it compiles to:\n\n``` ts\nlet count = ref(0)\ntrackChange(count.value)\n```\n\nHere `count.value` is passed as a number, whereas `trackChange` expects an actual ref. This can be fixed by wrapping `count` with `$$()` before passing it:\n\n``` diff\nlet count = $ref(0)\n- trackChange(count)\n+ trackChange($$(count))\n```\n\nThe above compiles to:\n\n``` js\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nlet count = ref(0)\ntrackChange(count)\n```\n\nAs we can see, `$$()` is a macro that serves as an **escape hint**: reactive variables inside `$$()` will not get `.value` appended.\n\n### Returning inside function scope\n\nReactivity can also be lost if reactive variables are used directly in a returned expression:\n\n``` ts\nfunction useMouse() {\n  let x = $ref(0)\n  let y = $ref(0)\n\n  // listen to mousemove...\n\n  // doesn't work!\n  return {\n    x,\n    y\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above return statement compiles to:\n\n``` ts\nreturn {\n  x: x.value,\n  y: y.value\n}\n```\n\nIn order to retain reactivity, we should be returning the actual refs, not the current value at return time.\n\nAgain, we can use `$$()` to fix this. In this case, `$$()` can be used directly on the returned object - any reference to reactive variables inside the `$$()` call will retain the reference to their underlying refs:\n\n``` ts\nfunction useMouse() {\n  let x = $ref(0)\n  let y = $ref(0)\n\n  // listen to mousemove...\n\n  // fixed\n  return $$({\n    x,\n    y\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Using `$$()` on destructured props\n\n`$$()` works on destructured props since they are reactive variables as well. The compiler will convert it with `toRef` for efficiency:\n\n``` ts\nconst { count } = defineProps<{ count: number }>()\n\npassAsRef($$(count))\n```\n\ncompiles to:\n\n``` js\nsetup(props) {\n  const __props_count = toRef(props, 'count')\n  passAsRef(__props_count)\n}\n```\n\n## TypeScript Integration\n\nVue provides typings for these macros (available globally) and all types will work as expected. There are no incompatibilities with standard TypeScript semantics, so the syntax will work with all existing tooling.\n\nThis also means the macros can work in any files where valid JS / TS are allowed - not just inside Vue SFCs.\n\nSince the macros are available globally, their types need to be explicitly referenced (e.g. in a `env.d.ts` file):\n\n``` ts\n/// <reference types=\"vue/macros-global\" />\n```\n\nWhen explicitly importing the macros from `vue/macros`, the type will work without declaring the globals.\n\n## Explicit Opt-in\n\n**No longer supported in core**\n\nThe following only applies up to Vue version 3.3 and below. Support has been removed in Vue core 3.4 and above, and `@vitejs/plugin-vue` 5.0 and above. If you intend to continue using the transform, please migrate to [Vue Macros](https://vue-macros.sxzz.moe/features/reactivity-transform.html) instead.\n\n### Vite\n\n- Requires `@vitejs/plugin-vue@>=2.0.0`\n- Applies to SFCs and js(x)/ts(x) files. A fast usage check is performed on files before applying the transform so there should be no performance cost for files not using the macros.\n- Note `reactivityTransform` is now a plugin root-level option instead of nested as `script.refSugar`, since it affects not just SFCs.\n\n``` js\n// vite.config.js\nexport default {\n  plugins: [\n    vue({\n      reactivityTransform: true\n    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### `vue-cli`\n\n- Currently only affects SFCs\n- Requires `vue-loader@>=17.0.0`\n\n``` js\n// vue.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  chainWebpack: (config) => {\n    config.module\n      .rule('vue')\n      .use('vue-loader')\n      .tap((options) => {\n        return {\n          ...options,\n          reactivityTransform: true\n        }\n      })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Plain `webpack` + `vue-loader`\n\n- Currently only affects SFCs\n- Requires `vue-loader@>=17.0.0`\n\n``` js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.vue$/,\n        loader: 'vue-loader',\n        options: {\n          reactivityTransform: true\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-transform](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-transform)"

  summary: Creates virtual DOM nodes (vnodes)
  description: "# Render Function APIs\n\n## h()\n\nCreates virtual DOM nodes (vnodes).\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  // full signature\n  function h(\n    type: string | Component,\n    props?: object | null,\n    children?: Children | Slot | Slots\n  ): VNode\n\n  // omitting props\n  function h(type: string | Component, children?: Children | Slot): VNode\n\n  type Children = string | number | boolean | VNode | null | Children[]\n\n  type Slot = () => Children\n\n  type Slots = { [name: string]: Slot }\n  ```\n\n  > Types are simplified for readability.\n\n- **Details**\n\n  The first argument can either be a string (for native elements) or a Vue component definition. The second argument is the props to be passed, and the third argument is the children.\n\n  When creating a component vnode, the children must be passed as slot functions. A single slot function can be passed if the component expects only the default slot. Otherwise, the slots must be passed as an object of slot functions.\n\n  For convenience, the props argument can be omitted when the children is not a slots object.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Creating native elements:\n\n  ``` js\n  import { h } from 'vue'\n\n  // all arguments except the type are optional\n  h('div')\n  h('div', { id: 'foo' })\n\n  // both attributes and properties can be used in props\n  // Vue automatically picks the right way to assign it\n  h('div', { class: 'bar', innerHTML: 'hello' })\n\n  // class and style have the same object / array\n  // value support like in templates\n  h('div', { class: [foo, { bar }], style: { color: 'red' } })\n\n  // event listeners should be passed as onXxx\n  h('div', { onClick: () => {} })\n\n  // children can be a string\n  h('div', { id: 'foo' }, 'hello')\n\n  // props can be omitted when there are no props\n  h('div', 'hello')\n  h('div', [h('span', 'hello')])\n\n  // children array can contain mixed vnodes and strings\n  h('div', ['hello', h('span', 'hello')])\n  ```\n\n  Creating components:\n\n  ``` js\n  import Foo from './Foo.vue'\n\n  // passing props\n  h(Foo, {\n    // equivalent of some-prop=\"hello\"\n    someProp: 'hello',\n    // equivalent of @update=\"() => {}\"\n    onUpdate: () => {}\n  })\n\n  // passing single default slot\n  h(Foo, () => 'default slot')\n\n  // passing named slots\n  // notice the `null` is required to avoid\n  // slots object being treated as props\n  h(MyComponent, null, {\n    default: () => 'default slot',\n    foo: () => h('div', 'foo'),\n    bar: () => [h('span', 'one'), h('span', 'two')]\n  })\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Render Functions - Creating VNodes](../guide/extras/render-function#creating-vnodes)\n\n## mergeProps()\n\nMerge multiple props objects with special handling for certain props.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function mergeProps(...args: object[]): object\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  `mergeProps()` supports merging multiple props objects with special handling for the following props:\n\n  - `class`\n  - `style`\n  - `onXxx` event listeners - multiple listeners with the same name will be merged into an array.\n\n  If you do not need the merge behavior and want simple overwrites, native object spread can be used instead.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { mergeProps } from 'vue'\n\n  const one = {\n    class: 'foo',\n    onClick: handlerA\n  }\n\n  const two = {\n    class: { bar: true },\n    onClick: handlerB\n  }\n\n  const merged = mergeProps(one, two)\n  /**\n   {\n     class: 'foo bar',\n     onClick: [handlerA, handlerB]\n   }\n   */\n  ```\n\n## cloneVNode()\n\nClones a vnode.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function cloneVNode(vnode: VNode, extraProps?: object): VNode\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Returns a cloned vnode, optionally with extra props to merge with the original.\n\n  Vnodes should be considered immutable once created, and you should not mutate the props of an existing vnode. Instead, clone it with different / extra props.\n\n  Vnodes have special internal properties, so cloning them is not as simple as an object spread. `cloneVNode()` handles most of the internal logic.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { h, cloneVNode } from 'vue'\n\n  const original = h('div')\n  const cloned = cloneVNode(original, { id: 'foo' })\n  ```\n\n## isVNode()\n\nChecks if a value is a vnode.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function isVNode(value: unknown): boolean\n  ```\n\n## resolveComponent()\n\nFor manually resolving a registered component by name.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function resolveComponent(name: string): Component | string\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  **Note: you do not need this if you can import the component directly.**\n\n  `resolveComponent()` must be called inside either `setup()` or the render function in order to resolve from the correct component context.\n\n  If the component is not found, a runtime warning will be emitted, and the name string is returned.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` js\n  import { h, resolveComponent } from 'vue'\n\n  export default {\n    setup() {\n      const ButtonCounter = resolveComponent('ButtonCounter')\n\n      return () => {\n        return h(ButtonCounter)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ``` js\n  import { h, resolveComponent } from 'vue'\n\n  export default {\n    render() {\n      const ButtonCounter = resolveComponent('ButtonCounter')\n      return h(ButtonCounter)\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Render Functions - Components](../guide/extras/render-function#components)\n\n## resolveDirective()\n\nFor manually resolving a registered directive by name.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function resolveDirective(name: string): Directive | undefined\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  **Note: you do not need this if you can import the directive directly.**\n\n  `resolveDirective()` must be called inside either `setup()` or the render function in order to resolve from the correct component context.\n\n  If the directive is not found, a runtime warning will be emitted, and the function returns `undefined`.\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Render Functions - Custom Directives](../guide/extras/render-function#custom-directives)\n\n## withDirectives()\n\nFor adding custom directives to vnodes.\n\n- **Type**\n\n  ``` ts\n  function withDirectives(\n    vnode: VNode,\n    directives: DirectiveArguments\n  ): VNode\n\n  // [Directive, value, argument, modifiers]\n  type DirectiveArguments = Array<\n    | [Directive]\n    | [Directive, any]\n    | [Directive, any, string]\n    | [Directive, any, string, DirectiveModifiers]\n  >\n  ```\n\n- **Details**\n\n  Wraps an existing vnode with custom directives. The second argument is an array of custom directives. Each custom directive is also represented as an array in the form of `[Directive, value, argument, modifiers]`.

  summary: When a <style> tag has the scoped attribute, its CSS will apply to elements of the current component only
  description: "# SFC CSS Features\n\n## Scoped CSS\n\nWhen a `<style>` tag has the `scoped` attribute, its CSS will apply to elements of the current component only. This is similar to the style encapsulation found in Shadow DOM. It comes with some caveats, but doesn't require any polyfills. It is achieved by using PostCSS to transform the following:\n\n``` javascript\n<style scoped>\n.example {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"example\">hi</div>\n</template>\n```\n\nInto the following:\n\n``` javascript\n<style>\n.example[data-v-f3f3eg9] {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"example\" data-v-f3f3eg9>hi</div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Child Component Root Elements\n\nWith `scoped`, the parent component's styles will not leak into child components. However, a child component's root node will be affected by both the parent's scoped CSS and the child's scoped CSS. This is by design so that the parent can style the child root element for layout purposes.\n\n### Deep Selectors\n\nIf you want a selector in `scoped` styles to be \"deep\", i.e. affecting child components, you can use the `:deep()` pseudo-class:\n\n``` javascript\n<style scoped>\n.a :deep(.b) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThe above will be compiled into:\n\n``` css\n.a[data-v-f3f3eg9] .b {\n  /* ... */\n}\n```\n\n**TIP**\n\nDOM content created with `v-html` are not affected by scoped styles, but you can still style them using deep selectors.\n\n### Slotted Selectors\n\nBy default, scoped styles do not affect contents rendered by `<slot/>`, as they are considered to be owned by the parent component passing them in. To explicitly target slot content, use the `:slotted` pseudo-class:\n\n``` javascript\n<style scoped>\n:slotted(div) {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Global Selectors\n\nIf you want just one rule to apply globally, you can use the `:global` pseudo-class rather than creating another `<style>` (see below):\n\n``` javascript\n<style scoped>\n:global(.red) {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Mixing Local and Global Styles\n\nYou can also include both scoped and non-scoped styles in the same component:\n\n``` javascript\n<style>\n/* global styles */\n</style>\n\n<style scoped>\n/* local styles */\n</style>\n```\n\n### Scoped Style Tips\n\n- **Scoped styles do not eliminate the need for classes**. Due to the way browsers render various CSS selectors, `p { color: red }` will be many times slower when scoped (i.e. when combined with an attribute selector). If you use classes or ids instead, such as in `.example { color: red }`, then you virtually eliminate that performance hit.\n\n- **Be careful with descendant selectors in recursive components!** For a CSS rule with the selector `.a .b`, if the element that matches `.a` contains a recursive child component, then all `.b` in that child component will be matched by the rule.\n\n## CSS Modules\n\nA `<style module>` tag is compiled as [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and exposes the resulting CSS classes to the component as an object under the key of `$style`:\n\n``` javascript\n<template>\n  <p :class=\"$style.red\">This should be red</p>\n</template>\n\n<style module>\n.red {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThe resulting classes are hashed to avoid collision, achieving the same effect of scoping the CSS to the current component only.\n\nRefer to the [CSS Modules spec](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for more details such as [global exceptions](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#exceptions) and [composition](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#composition).\n\n### Custom Inject Name\n\nYou can customize the property key of the injected classes object by giving the `module` attribute a value:\n\n``` javascript\n<template>\n  <p :class=\"classes.red\">red</p>\n</template>\n\n<style module=\"classes\">\n.red {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Usage with Composition API\n\nThe injected classes can be accessed in `setup()` and `<script setup>` via the `useCssModule` API. For `<style module>` blocks with custom injection names, `useCssModule` accepts the matching `module` attribute value as the first argument:\n\n``` js\nimport { useCssModule } from 'vue'\n\n// inside setup() scope...\n// default, returns classes for <style module>\nuseCssModule()\n\n// named, returns classes for <style module=\"classes\">\nuseCssModule('classes')\n```\n\n## `v-bind()` in CSS\n\nSFC `<style>` tags support linking CSS values to dynamic component state using the `v-bind` CSS function:\n\n``` javascript\n<template>\n  <div class=\"text\">hello</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      color: 'red'\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style>\n.text {\n  color: v-bind(color);\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThe syntax works with [`<script setup>`](sfc-script-setup), and supports JavaScript expressions (must be wrapped in quotes):\n\n``` javascript\n<script setup>\nconst theme = {\n  color: 'red'\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <p>hello</p>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\np {\n  color: v-bind('theme.color');\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThe actual value will be compiled into a hashed CSS custom property, so the CSS is still static. The custom property will be applied to the component's root element via inline styles and reactively updated if the source value changes.\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features)"
- name: SFC Syntax Specification
  id: api/sfc-spec
  summary: A Vue Single-File Component (SFC), conventionally using the *.vue file extension, is a custom file format that uses an HTML-like syntax to describe a Vue component
  description: "# SFC Syntax Specification\n\n## Overview\n\nA Vue Single-File Component (SFC), conventionally using the `*.vue` file extension, is a custom file format that uses an HTML-like syntax to describe a Vue component. A Vue SFC is syntactically compatible with HTML.\n\nEach `*.vue` file consists of three types of top-level language blocks: `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style>`, and optionally additional custom blocks:\n\n``` javascript\n<template>\n  <div class=\"example\">{{ msg }}</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      msg: 'Hello world!'\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style>\n.example {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n\n<custom1>\n  This could be e.g. documentation for the component.\n</custom1>\n```\n\n## Language Blocks\n\n### `<template>`\n\n- Each `*.vue` file can contain at most one top-level `<template>` block.\n\n- Contents will be extracted and passed on to `@vue/compiler-dom`, pre-compiled into JavaScript render functions, and attached to the exported component as its `render` option.\n\n### `<script>`\n\n- Each `*.vue` file can contain at most one `<script>` block (excluding [`<script setup>`](sfc-script-setup)).\n\n- The script is executed as an ES Module.\n\n- The **default export** should be a Vue component options object, either as a plain object or as the return value of [defineComponent](general#definecomponent).\n\n### `<script setup>`\n\n- Each `*.vue` file can contain at most one `<script setup>` block (excluding normal `<script>`).\n\n- The script is pre-processed and used as the component's `setup()` function, which means it will be executed **for each instance of the component**. Top-level bindings in `<script setup>` are automatically exposed to the template. For more details, see [dedicated documentation on `<script setup>`](sfc-script-setup).\n\n### `<style>`\n\n- A single `*.vue` file can contain multiple `<style>` tags.\n\n- A `<style>` tag can have `scoped` or `module` attributes (see [SFC Style Features](sfc-css-features) for more details) to help encapsulate the styles to the current component. Multiple `<style>` tags with different encapsulation modes can be mixed in the same component.\n\n### Custom Blocks\n\nAdditional custom blocks can be included in a `*.vue` file for any project-specific needs, for example a `<docs>` block. Some real-world examples of custom blocks include:\n\n- [Gridsome: `<page-query>`](https://gridsome.org/docs/querying-data/)\n- [vite-plugin-vue-gql: `<gql>`](https://github.com/wheatjs/vite-plugin-vue-gql)\n- [vue-i18n: `<i18n>`](https://github.com/intlify/bundle-tools/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-vue-i18n#i18n-custom-block)\n\nHandling of Custom Blocks will depend on tooling - if you want to build your own custom block integrations, see the [SFC custom block integrations tooling section](../guide/scaling-up/tooling#sfc-custom-block-integrations) for more details.\n\n## Automatic Name Inference\n\nAn SFC automatically infers the component's name from its **filename** in the following cases:\n\n- Dev warning formatting\n- DevTools inspection\n- Recursive self-reference, e.g. a file named `FooBar.vue` can refer to itself as `<FooBar/>` in its template. This has lower priority than explicitly registered/imported components.\n\n## Pre-Processors\n\nBlocks can declare pre-processor languages using the `lang` attribute. The most common case is using TypeScript for the `<script>` block:\n\n``` template\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n  // use TypeScript\n</script>\n```\n\n`lang` can be applied to any block - for example we can use `<style>` with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and `<template>` with [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html):\n\n``` template\n<template lang=\"pug\">\np {{ msg }}\n</template>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\">\n  $primary-color: #333;\n  body {\n    color: $primary-color;\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\nNote that integration with various pre-processors may differ by toolchain. Check out the respective documentation for examples:\n\n- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors)\n- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/css.html#pre-processors)\n- [webpack + vue-loader](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/pre-processors.html#using-pre-processors)\n\n## `src` Imports\n\nIf you prefer splitting up your `*.vue` components into multiple files, you can use the `src` attribute to import an external file for a language block:\n\n``` javascript\n<template src=\"./template.html\"></template>\n<style src=\"./style.css\"></style>\n<script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n```\n\nBeware that `src` imports follow the same path resolution rules as webpack module requests, which means:\n\n- Relative paths need to start with `./`\n- You can import resources from npm dependencies:\n\n``` javascript\n<!-- import a file from the installed \"todomvc-app-css\" npm package -->\n<style src=\"todomvc-app-css/index.css\" />\n```\n\n`src` imports also work with custom blocks, e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\n<unit-test src=\"./unit-test.js\">\n</unit-test>\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nInside each block you shall use the comment syntax of the language being used (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Pug, etc.). For top-level comments, use HTML comment syntax: `<!-- comment contents here -->`\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-spec](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-spec)"

    ## Automatic Name Inference

    An SFC automatically infers the component's name from its **filename** in the following cases:

    - Dev warning formatting
    - DevTools inspection
    - Recursive self-reference, e.g. a file named `FooBar.vue` can refer to itself as `<FooBar/>` in its template. This has lower priority than explicitly registered/imported components.

  id: api/sfc-script-setup#basic-syntax
  summary: The code inside is compiled as the content of the component's setup() function
  belongs_to: <script setup>
  description: |-
    ## Basic Syntax

    To opt-in to the syntax, add the `setup` attribute to the `<script>` block:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    console.log('hello script setup')
    </script>
    ```

    The code inside is compiled as the content of the component's `setup()` function. This means that unlike normal `<script>`, which only executes once when the component is first imported, code inside `<script setup>` will **execute every time an instance of the component is created**.

    ### Top-level bindings are exposed to template

    When using `<script setup>`, any top-level bindings (including variables, function declarations, and imports) declared inside `<script setup>` are directly usable in the template:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    // variable
    const msg = 'Hello!'

    // functions
    function log() {
      console.log(msg)
    }
    </script>

    <template>
      <button @click="log">{{ msg }}</button>
    </template>
    ```

    Imports are exposed in the same fashion. This means you can directly use an imported helper function in template expressions without having to expose it via the `methods` option:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    import { capitalize } from './helpers'
    </script>

    <template>
      <div>{{ capitalize('hello') }}</div>
    </template>

  description: |-
    ## CSS Modules

    A `<style module>` tag is compiled as [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and exposes the resulting CSS classes to the component as an object under the key of `$style`:

    ``` javascript
    <template>
      <p :class="$style.red">This should be red</p>
    </template>

    <style module>
    .red {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>
    ```

    The resulting classes are hashed to avoid collision, achieving the same effect of scoping the CSS to the current component only.

    Refer to the [CSS Modules spec](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for more details such as [global exceptions](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#exceptions) and [composition](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#composition).

    ### Custom Inject Name

    You can customize the property key of the injected classes object by giving the `module` attribute a value:

    ``` javascript
    <template>
      <p :class="classes.red">red</p>
    </template>

    <style module="classes">
    .red {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>
    ```

    ### Usage with Composition API

    The injected classes can be accessed in `setup()` and `<script setup>` via the `useCssModule` API. For `<style module>` blocks with custom injection names, `useCssModule` accepts the matching `module` attribute value as the first argument:

    ``` js
    import { useCssModule } from 'vue'

    // inside setup() scope...
    // default, returns classes for <style module>
    useCssModule()

    // named, returns classes for <style module="classes">
    useCssModule('classes')
    ```

  id: api/sfc-script-setup#defineexpose
  summary: Components using <script setup> are closed by default - i.e

  description: |-
    ## defineExpose()

    Components using `<script setup>` are **closed by default** - i.e. the public instance of the component, which is retrieved via template refs or `$parent` chains, will **not** expose any of the bindings declared inside `<script setup>`.

    To explicitly expose properties in a `<script setup>` component, use the `defineExpose` compiler macro:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    import { ref } from 'vue'

    const a = 1
    const b = ref(2)

    defineExpose({
      a,
      b
    })

    When a parent gets an instance of this component via template refs, the retrieved instance will be of the shape `{ a: number, b: number }` (refs are automatically unwrapped just like on normal instances).

  description: |-
    ## defineModel()

    This macro can be used to declare a two-way binding prop that can be consumed via `v-model` from the parent component. Example usage is also discussed in the [Component `v-model`](../guide/components/v-model) guide.

    Under the hood, this macro declares a model prop and a corresponding value update event. If the first argument is a literal string, it will be used as the prop name; Otherwise the prop name will default to `"modelValue"`. In both cases, you can also pass an additional object which can include the prop's options and the model ref's value transform options.

    ``` js
    // declares "modelValue" prop, consumed by parent via v-model
    const model = defineModel()
    // OR: declares "modelValue" prop with options
    const model = defineModel({ type: String })

    // emits "update:modelValue" when mutated
    model.value = 'hello'

    // declares "count" prop, consumed by parent via v-model:count
    const count = defineModel('count')
    // OR: declares "count" prop with options
    const count = defineModel('count', { type: Number, default: 0 })

    function inc() {
      // emits "update:count" when mutated
      count.value++
    }
    ```

    ### Modifiers and Transformers

    To access modifiers used with the `v-model` directive, we can destructure the return value of `defineModel()` like this:

    ``` js
    const [modelValue, modelModifiers] = defineModel()

    // corresponds to v-model.trim
    if (modelModifiers.trim) {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    When a modifier is present, we likely need to transform the value when reading or syncing it back to the parent. We can achieve this by using the `get` and `set` transformer options:

    ``` js
    const [modelValue, modelModifiers] = defineModel({
      // get() omitted as it is not needed here
      set(value) {
        // if the .trim modifier is used, return trimmed value
        if (modelModifiers.trim) {
          return value.trim()
        }
        // otherwise, return the value as-is
        return value
      }
    })
    ```

    ### Usage with TypeScript

    Like `defineProps` and `defineEmits`, `defineModel` can also receive type arguments to specify the types of the model value and the modifiers:

    ``` ts
    const modelValue = defineModel<string>()
    //    ^? Ref<string | undefined>

    // default model with options, required removes possible undefined values
    const modelValue = defineModel<string>({ required: true })
    //    ^? Ref<string>

    const [modelValue, modifiers] = defineModel<string, 'trim' | 'uppercase'>()
    //                 ^? Record<'trim' | 'uppercase', true | undefined>
    ```

    ## defineOptions()

    This macro can be used to declare component options directly inside `<script setup>` without having to use a separate `<script>` block:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    defineOptions({
      inheritAttrs: false,
      customOptions: {
        /* ... */
      }
    })
    </script>
    ```

    - Only supported in 3.3+.
    - This is a macro. The options will be hoisted to module scope and cannot access local variables in `<script setup>` that are not literal constants.

  belongs_to: <script setup>
  description: |-
    ## defineProps() & defineEmits()

    To declare options like `props` and `emits` with full type inference support, we can use the `defineProps` and `defineEmits` APIs, which are automatically available inside `<script setup>`:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    const props = defineProps({
      foo: String
    })

    const emit = defineEmits(['change', 'delete'])
    // setup code
    </script>
    ```

    - `defineProps` and `defineEmits` are **compiler macros** only usable inside `<script setup>`. They do not need to be imported, and are compiled away when `<script setup>` is processed.

    - `defineProps` accepts the same value as the `props` option, while `defineEmits` accepts the same value as the `emits` option.

    - `defineProps` and `defineEmits` provide proper type inference based on the options passed.

    - The options passed to `defineProps` and `defineEmits` will be hoisted out of setup into module scope. Therefore, the options cannot reference local variables declared in setup scope. Doing so will result in a compile error. However, it *can* reference imported bindings since they are in the module scope as well.

    ### Type-only props/emit declarations

    Props and emits can also be declared using pure-type syntax by passing a literal type argument to `defineProps` or `defineEmits`:

    ``` ts
    const props = defineProps<{
      foo: string
      bar?: number
    }>()

    const emit = defineEmits<{
      (e: 'change', id: number): void
      (e: 'update', value: string): void
    }>()

    // 3.3+: alternative, more succinct syntax
    const emit = defineEmits<{
      change: [id: number] // named tuple syntax
      update: [value: string]
    }>()
    ```

    - `defineProps` or `defineEmits` can only use either runtime declaration OR type declaration. Using both at the same time will result in a compile error.

    - When using type declaration, the equivalent runtime declaration is automatically generated from static analysis to remove the need for double declaration and still ensure correct runtime behavior.

      - In dev mode, the compiler will try to infer corresponding runtime validation from the types. For example here `foo: String` is inferred from the `foo: string` type. If the type is a reference to an imported type, the inferred result will be `foo: null` (equal to `any` type) since the compiler does not have information of external files.

      - In prod mode, the compiler will generate the array format declaration to reduce bundle size (the props here will be compiled into `['foo', 'bar']`)

    - In version 3.2 and below, the generic type parameter for `defineProps()` were limited to a type literal or a reference to a local interface.

      This limitation has been resolved in 3.3. The latest version of Vue supports referencing imported and a limited set of complex types in the type parameter position. However, because the type to runtime conversion is still AST-based, some complex types that require actual type analysis, e.g. conditional types, are not supported. You can use conditional types for the type of a single prop, but not the entire props object.

    ### Default props values when using type declaration

    One drawback of the type-only `defineProps` declaration is that it doesn't have a way to provide default values for the props. To resolve this problem, a `withDefaults` compiler macro is also provided:

    ``` ts
    export interface Props {
      msg?: string
      labels?: string[]
    }

    const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
      msg: 'hello',
      labels: () => ['one', 'two']
    })
    ```

    This will be compiled to equivalent runtime props `default` options. In addition, the `withDefaults` helper provides type checks for the default values, and ensures the returned `props` type has the optional flags removed for properties that do have default values declared.

    ## defineSlots()

    This macro can be used to provide type hints to IDEs for slot name and props type checking.

    `defineSlots()` only accepts a type parameter and no runtime arguments. The type parameter should be a type literal where the property key is the slot name, and the value type is the slot function. The first argument of the function is the props the slot expects to receive, and its type will be used for slot props in the template. The return type is currently ignored and can be `any`, but we may leverage it for slot content checking in the future.

    It also returns the `slots` object, which is equivalent to the `slots` object exposed on the setup context or returned by `useSlots()`.

    ``` javascript
    <script setup lang="ts">
    const slots = defineSlots<{
      default(props: { msg: string }): any
    }>()
    </script>
    ```

    - Only supported in 3.3+.

    ## Generics

    Generic type parameters can be declared using the `generic` attribute on the `<script>` tag:

    The value of `generic` works exactly the same as the parameter list between `<...>` in TypeScript. For example, you can use multiple parameters, `extends` constraints, default types, and reference imported types:

    ``` javascript
    <script
      setup
      lang="ts"
      generic="T extends string | number, U extends Item"
    >
    import type { Item } from './types'

  summary: Each *.vue file can contain at most one top-level <template> block

  description: |-
    ## Language Blocks

    ### `<template>`

    - Each `*.vue` file can contain at most one top-level `<template>` block.

    - Contents will be extracted and passed on to `@vue/compiler-dom`, pre-compiled into JavaScript render functions, and attached to the exported component as its `render` option.

    ### `<script>`

    - Each `*.vue` file can contain at most one `<script>` block (excluding [`<script setup>`](sfc-script-setup)).

    - The script is executed as an ES Module.

    - The **default export** should be a Vue component options object, either as a plain object or as the return value of [defineComponent](general#definecomponent).

    ### `<script setup>`

    - Each `*.vue` file can contain at most one `<script setup>` block (excluding normal `<script>`).

    - The script is pre-processed and used as the component's `setup()` function, which means it will be executed **for each instance of the component**. Top-level bindings in `<script setup>` are automatically exposed to the template. For more details, see [dedicated documentation on `<script setup>`](sfc-script-setup).

    ### `<style>`

    - A single `*.vue` file can contain multiple `<style>` tags.

    - A `<style>` tag can have `scoped` or `module` attributes (see [SFC Style Features](sfc-css-features) for more details) to help encapsulate the styles to the current component. Multiple `<style>` tags with different encapsulation modes can be mixed in the same component.

    ### Custom Blocks

    Additional custom blocks can be included in a `*.vue` file for any project-specific needs, for example a `<docs>` block. Some real-world examples of custom blocks include:

    - [Gridsome: `<page-query>`](https://gridsome.org/docs/querying-data/)
    - [vite-plugin-vue-gql: `<gql>`](https://github.com/wheatjs/vite-plugin-vue-gql)
    - [vue-i18n: `<i18n>`](https://github.com/intlify/bundle-tools/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-vue-i18n#i18n-custom-block)

    Handling of Custom Blocks will depend on tooling - if you want to build your own custom block integrations, see the [SFC custom block integrations tooling section](../guide/scaling-up/tooling#sfc-custom-block-integrations) for more details.

    ## Overview

    A Vue Single-File Component (SFC), conventionally using the `*.vue` file extension, is a custom file format that uses an HTML-like syntax to describe a Vue component. A Vue SFC is syntactically compatible with HTML.

    Each `*.vue` file consists of three types of top-level language blocks: `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style>`, and optionally additional custom blocks:

    ``` javascript
    <template>
      <div class="example">{{ msg }}</div>
    </template>

    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          msg: 'Hello world!'
        }
      }
    }
    </script>

    <style>
    .example {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>

    <custom1>
      This could be e.g. documentation for the component.

  description: |-
    ## Pre-Processors

    Blocks can declare pre-processor languages using the `lang` attribute. The most common case is using TypeScript for the `<script>` block:

    ``` template
    <script lang="ts">
      // use TypeScript
    </script>
    ```

    `lang` can be applied to any block - for example we can use `<style>` with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and `<template>` with [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html):

    ``` template
    <template lang="pug">
    p {{ msg }}
    </template>

    <style lang="scss">
      $primary-color: #333;
      body {
        color: $primary-color;
      }
    </style>
    ```

    Note that integration with various pre-processors may differ by toolchain. Check out the respective documentation for examples:

    - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors)
    - [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/css.html#pre-processors)

  belongs_to: SFC CSS Features
  description: |-
    ## Scoped CSS

    When a `<style>` tag has the `scoped` attribute, its CSS will apply to elements of the current component only. This is similar to the style encapsulation found in Shadow DOM. It comes with some caveats, but doesn't require any polyfills. It is achieved by using PostCSS to transform the following:

    ``` javascript
    <style scoped>
    .example {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>

    <template>
      <div class="example">hi</div>
    </template>
    ```

    Into the following:

    ``` javascript
    <style>
    .example[data-v-f3f3eg9] {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>

    <template>
      <div class="example" data-v-f3f3eg9>hi</div>
    </template>
    ```

    ### Child Component Root Elements

    With `scoped`, the parent component's styles will not leak into child components. However, a child component's root node will be affected by both the parent's scoped CSS and the child's scoped CSS. This is by design so that the parent can style the child root element for layout purposes.

    ### Deep Selectors

    If you want a selector in `scoped` styles to be "deep", i.e. affecting child components, you can use the `:deep()` pseudo-class:

    ``` javascript
    <style scoped>
    .a :deep(.b) {
      /* ... */
    }
    </style>
    ```

    The above will be compiled into:

    ``` css
    .a[data-v-f3f3eg9] .b {
      /* ... */
    }
    ```

    **TIP**

    DOM content created with `v-html` are not affected by scoped styles, but you can still style them using deep selectors.

    ### Slotted Selectors

    By default, scoped styles do not affect contents rendered by `<slot/>`, as they are considered to be owned by the parent component passing them in. To explicitly target slot content, use the `:slotted` pseudo-class:

    ``` javascript
    <style scoped>
    :slotted(div) {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>
    ```

    ### Global Selectors

    If you want just one rule to apply globally, you can use the `:global` pseudo-class rather than creating another `<style>` (see below):

    ``` javascript
    <style scoped>
    :global(.red) {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>
    ```

    ### Mixing Local and Global Styles

    You can also include both scoped and non-scoped styles in the same component:

    ``` javascript
    <style>
    /* global styles */
    </style>

    <style scoped>
    /* local styles */
    </style>
    ```

    ### Scoped Style Tips

    - **Scoped styles do not eliminate the need for classes**. Due to the way browsers render various CSS selectors, `p { color: red }` will be many times slower when scoped (i.e. when combined with an attribute selector). If you use classes or ids instead, such as in `.example { color: red }`, then you virtually eliminate that performance hit.

    - **Be careful with descendant selectors in recursive components!** For a CSS rule with the selector `.a .b`, if the element that matches `.a` contains a recursive child component, then all `.b` in that child component will be matched by the rule.

    ## `src` Imports

    If you prefer splitting up your `*.vue` components into multiple files, you can use the `src` attribute to import an external file for a language block:

    ``` javascript
    <template src="./template.html"></template>
    <style src="./style.css"></style>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
    ```

    Beware that `src` imports follow the same path resolution rules as webpack module requests, which means:

    - Relative paths need to start with `./`
    - You can import resources from npm dependencies:

    ``` javascript
    <!-- import a file from the installed "todomvc-app-css" npm package -->
    <style src="todomvc-app-css/index.css" />
    ```

    `src` imports also work with custom blocks, e.g.:

    ``` javascript
    <unit-test src="./unit-test.js">
    </unit-test>
    ```

  belongs_to: <script setup>
  description: |-
    ## Usage alongside normal `<script>`

    `<script setup>` can be used alongside normal `<script>`. A normal `<script>` may be needed in cases where we need to:

    - Declare options that cannot be expressed in `<script setup>`, for example `inheritAttrs` or custom options enabled via plugins (Can be replaced by [`defineOptions`](sfc-script-setup#defineoptions) in 3.3+).
    - Declaring named exports.
    - Run side effects or create objects that should only execute once.

    ``` javascript
    <script>
    // normal <script>, executed in module scope (only once)
    runSideEffectOnce()

    // declare additional options
    export default {
      inheritAttrs: false,
      customOptions: {}
    }
    </script>

    <script setup>
    // executed in setup() scope (for each instance)
    </script>
    ```

    Support for combining `<script setup>` and `<script>` in the same component is limited to the scenarios described above. Specifically:

    - Do **NOT** use a separate `<script>` section for options that can already be defined using `<script setup>`, such as `props` and `emits`.
    - Variables created inside `<script setup>` are not added as properties to the component instance, making them inaccessible from the Options API. Mixing APIs in this way is strongly discouraged.

    If you find yourself in one of the scenarios that is not supported then you should consider switching to an explicit [`setup()`](composition-api-setup) function, instead of using `<script setup>`.

    ## `useSlots()` & `useAttrs()`

    Usage of `slots` and `attrs` inside `<script setup>` should be relatively rare, since you can access them directly as `$slots` and `$attrs` in the template. In the rare case where you do need them, use the `useSlots` and `useAttrs` helpers respectively:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    import { useSlots, useAttrs } from 'vue'

    const slots = useSlots()
    const attrs = useAttrs()
    </script>
    ```

    `useSlots` and `useAttrs` are actual runtime functions that return the equivalent of `setupContext.slots` and `setupContext.attrs`. They can be used in normal composition API functions as well.

  description: |-
    ## Using Components

    Values in the scope of `<script setup>` can also be used directly as custom component tag names:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'
    </script>

    <template>
      <MyComponent />
    </template>
    ```

    Think of `MyComponent` as being referenced as a variable. If you have used JSX, the mental model is similar here. The kebab-case equivalent `<my-component>` also works in the template - however PascalCase component tags are strongly recommended for consistency. It also helps differentiating from native custom elements.

    ### Dynamic Components

    Since components are referenced as variables instead of registered under string keys, we should use dynamic `:is` binding when using dynamic components inside `<script setup>`:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    import Foo from './Foo.vue'
    import Bar from './Bar.vue'
    </script>

    <template>
      <component :is="Foo" />
      <component :is="someCondition ? Foo : Bar" />
    </template>
    ```

    Note how the components can be used as variables in a ternary expression.

    ### Recursive Components

    An SFC can implicitly refer to itself via its filename. E.g. a file named `FooBar.vue` can refer to itself as `<FooBar/>` in its template.

    Note this has lower priority than imported components. If you have a named import that conflicts with the component's inferred name, you can alias the import:

    ``` js
    import { FooBar as FooBarChild } from './components'
    ```

    ### Namespaced Components

    You can use component tags with dots like `<Foo.Bar>` to refer to components nested under object properties. This is useful when you import multiple components from a single file:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    import * as Form from './form-components'
    </script>

    <template>
      <Form.Input>
        <Form.Label>label</Form.Label>
      </Form.Input>
    </template>
    ```

    ## Using Custom Directives

    Globally registered custom directives just work as normal. Local custom directives don't need to be explicitly registered with `<script setup>`, but they must follow the naming scheme `vNameOfDirective`:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    const vMyDirective = {
      beforeMount: (el) => {
        // do something with the element
      }
    }
    </script>
    <template>
      <h1 v-my-directive>This is a Heading</h1>
    </template>
    ```

    If you're importing a directive from elsewhere, it can be renamed to fit the required naming scheme:

    ``` javascript
    <script setup>
    import { myDirective as vMyDirective } from './MyDirective.js'
    </script>
    ```

  description: "# Style Guide\n\nThis is the official style guide for Vue-specific code. If you use Vue in a project, it's a great reference to avoid errors, bikeshedding, and anti-patterns. However, we don't believe that any style guide is ideal for all teams or projects, so mindful deviations are encouraged based on past experience, the surrounding tech stack, and personal values.\n\nFor the most part, we also avoid suggestions about JavaScript or HTML in general. We don't mind whether you use semicolons or trailing commas. We don't mind whether your HTML uses single-quotes or double-quotes for attribute values. Some exceptions will exist however, where we've found that a particular pattern is helpful in the context of Vue.\n\nFinally, we've split rules into four categories:\n\n## Rule Categories\n\n### Priority A: Essential (Error Prevention)\n\nThese rules help prevent errors, so learn and abide by them at all costs. Exceptions may exist, but should be very rare and only be made by those with expert knowledge of both JavaScript and Vue.\n\n- [See all priority A rules](rules-essential)\n\n### Priority B: Strongly Recommended\n\nThese rules have been found to improve readability and/or developer experience in most projects. Your code will still run if you violate them, but violations should be rare and well-justified.\n\n- [See all priority B rules](rules-strongly-recommended)\n\n### Priority C: Recommended\n\nWhere multiple, equally good options exist, an arbitrary choice can be made to ensure consistency. In these rules, we describe each acceptable option and suggest a default choice. That means you can feel free to make a different choice in your own codebase, as long as you're consistent and have a good reason. Please do have a good reason though! By adapting to the community standard, you will:\n\n1.  Train your brain to more easily parse most of the community code you encounter\n2.  Be able to copy and paste most community code examples without modification\n3.

  summary: Never use v-if on the same element as v-for
  belongs_to: 'Priority A Rules: Essential'
  description: |-
    ## Avoid `v-if` with `v-for`

    **Never use `v-if` on the same element as `v-for`.**

    There are two common cases where this can be tempting:

    - To filter items in a list (e.g. `v-for="user in users" v-if="user.isActive"`). In these cases, replace `users` with a new computed property that returns your filtered list (e.g. `activeUsers`).

    - To avoid rendering a list if it should be hidden (e.g. `v-for="user in users" v-if="shouldShowUsers"`). In these cases, move the `v-if` to a container element (e.g. `ul`, `ol`).

    Detailed Explanation

    When Vue processes directives, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`, so that this template:

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <li
        v-for="user in users"
        v-if="user.isActive"
        :key="user.id"
      >
        {{ user.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```

    Will throw an error, because the `v-if` directive will be evaluated first and the iteration variable `user` does not exist at this moment.

    This could be fixed by iterating over a computed property instead, like this:

    ``` js
    computed: {
      activeUsers() {
        return this.users.filter(user => user.isActive)
      }
    }
    ```

    ``` js
    const activeUsers = computed(() => {
      return users.filter((user) => user.isActive)
    })
    ```

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <li
        v-for="user in activeUsers"
        :key="user.id"
      >
        {{ user.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```

    Alternatively, we can use a `<template>` tag with `v-for` to wrap the `<li>` element:

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <template v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">
        <li v-if="user.isActive">
          {{ user.name }}
        </li>
      </template>
    </ul>
    ```

    ### Bad

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <li
        v-for="user in users"
        v-if="user.isActive"
        :key="user.id"
      >
        {{ user.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```

    ### Good

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <li
        v-for="user in activeUsers"
        :key="user.id"
      >
        {{ user.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <template v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">
        <li v-if="user.isActive">
          {{ user.name }}
        </li>

  belongs_to: 'Priority B Rules: Strongly Recommended'
  description: "## Base component names\n\n**Base components (a.k.a. presentational, dumb, or pure components) that apply app-specific styling and conventions should all begin with a specific prefix, such as `Base`, `App`, or `V`.**\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nThese components lay the foundation for consistent styling and behavior in your application. They may **only** contain:\n\n- HTML elements,\n- other base components, and\n- 3rd-party UI components.\n\nBut they'll **never** contain global state (e.g. from a [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) store).\n\nTheir names often include the name of an element they wrap (e.g. `BaseButton`, `BaseTable`), unless no element exists for their specific purpose (e.g. `BaseIcon`). If you build similar components for a more specific context, they will almost always consume these components (e.g. `BaseButton` may be used in `ButtonSubmit`).\n\nSome advantages of this convention:\n\n- When organized alphabetically in editors, your app's base components are all listed together, making them easier to identify.\n\n- Since component names should always be multi-word, this convention prevents you from having to choose an arbitrary prefix for simple component wrappers (e.g. `MyButton`, `VueButton`).\n\n- Since these components are so frequently used, you may want to simply make them global instead of importing them everywhere. A prefix makes this possible with Webpack:\n\n  ``` js\n  const requireComponent = require.context(\n    './src',\n    true,\n    /Base[A-Z]\\w+\\.(vue|js)$/\n  )\n  requireComponent.keys().forEach(function (fileName) {\n    let baseComponentConfig = requireComponent(fileName)\n    baseComponentConfig =\n      baseComponentConfig.default || baseComponentConfig\n    const baseComponentName =\n      baseComponentConfig.name ||\n      fileName.replace(/^.+\\//, '').replace(/\\.\\w+$/, '')\n    app.component(baseComponentName, baseComponentConfig)\n  })\n  ```\n\n### Bad\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- MyButton.vue\n|- VueTable.vue\n|- Icon.vue\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- BaseButton.vue\n|- BaseTable.vue\n|- BaseIcon.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- AppButton.vue\n|- AppTable.vue\n|- AppIcon.vue\n```\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- VButton.vue\n|- VTable.vue\n|- VIcon.vue\n```"

    ## Component name casing in JS/JSX

    **Component names in JS/[JSX](../guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) should always be PascalCase, though they may be kebab-case inside strings for simpler applications that only use global component registration through `app.component`.**

    Detailed Explanation

    In JavaScript, PascalCase is the convention for classes and prototype constructors - essentially, anything that can have distinct instances. Vue components also have instances, so it makes sense to also use PascalCase. As an added benefit, using PascalCase within JSX (and templates) allows readers of the code to more easily distinguish between components and HTML elements.

    However, for applications that use **only** global component definitions via `app.component`, we recommend kebab-case instead. The reasons are:

    - It's rare that global components are ever referenced in JavaScript, so following a convention for JavaScript makes less sense.
    - These applications always include many in-DOM templates, where [kebab-case **must** be used](#component-name-casing-in-templates).

    ### Bad

    app.component('myComponent', {
      // ...

    ## Component name casing in templates

    **In most projects, component names should always be PascalCase in [Single-File Components](../guide/scaling-up/sfc) and string templates - but kebab-case in in-DOM templates.**

    PascalCase has a few advantages over kebab-case:

    - Editors can autocomplete component names in templates, because PascalCase is also used in JavaScript.
    - `<MyComponent>` is more visually distinct from a single-word HTML element than `<my-component>`, because there are two character differences (the two capitals), rather than just one (a hyphen).
    - If you use any non-Vue custom elements in your templates, such as a web component, PascalCase ensures that your Vue components remain distinctly visible.

    Unfortunately, due to HTML's case insensitivity, in-DOM templates must still use kebab-case.

    Also note that if you've already invested heavily in kebab-case, consistency with HTML conventions and being able to use the same casing across all your projects may be more important than the advantages listed above. In those cases, **using kebab-case everywhere is also acceptable.**

    ## Element selectors with `scoped`

    **Element selectors should be avoided with `scoped`.**

    Prefer class selectors over element selectors in `scoped` styles, because large numbers of element selectors are slow.

    Detailed Explanation

    To scope styles, Vue adds a unique attribute to component elements, such as `data-v-f3f3eg9`. Then selectors are modified so that only matching elements with this attribute are selected (e.g. `button[data-v-f3f3eg9]`).

    The problem is that large numbers of element-attribute selectors (e.g. `button[data-v-f3f3eg9]`) will be considerably slower than class-attribute selectors (e.g. `.btn-close[data-v-f3f3eg9]`), so class selectors should be preferred whenever possible.

  description: "## Order of words in component names\n\n**Component names should start with the highest-level (often most general) words and end with descriptive modifying words.**\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nYou may be wondering:\n\n> \"Why would we force component names to use less natural language?\"\n\nIn natural English, adjectives and other descriptors do typically appear before the nouns, while exceptions require connector words. For example:\n\n- Coffee *with* milk\n- Soup *of the* day\n- Visitor *to the* museum\n\nYou can definitely include these connector words in component names if you'd like, but the order is still important.\n\nAlso note that **what's considered \"highest-level\" will be contextual to your app**. For example, imagine an app with a search form. It may include components like this one:\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- ClearSearchButton.vue\n|- ExcludeFromSearchInput.vue\n|- LaunchOnStartupCheckbox.vue\n|- RunSearchButton.vue\n|- SearchInput.vue\n|- TermsCheckbox.vue\n```\n\nAs you might notice, it's quite difficult to see which components are specific to the search.

We only recommend considering this approach in very large apps (e.g. 100+ components), for these reasons:\n\n- It generally takes more time to navigate through nested sub-directories, than scrolling through a single `components` directory.\n- Name conflicts (e.g. multiple `ButtonDelete.vue` components) make it more difficult to quickly navigate to a specific component in a code editor.\n- Refactoring becomes more difficult, because find-and-replace often isn't sufficient to update relative references to a moved component.\n\n### Bad\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- ClearSearchButton.vue\n|- ExcludeFromSearchInput.vue\n|- LaunchOnStartupCheckbox.vue\n|- RunSearchButton.vue\n|- SearchInput.vue\n|- TermsCheckbox.vue\n```\n\n### Good\n\n``` \ncomponents/\n|- SearchButtonClear.vue\n|- SearchButtonRun.vue\n|- SearchInputQuery.vue\n|- SearchInputExcludeGlob.vue\n|- SettingsCheckboxTerms.vue\n|- SettingsCheckboxLaunchOnStartup.vue\n```"

    Components that self-close communicate that they not only have no content, but are **meant** to have no content. It's the difference between a blank page in a book and one labeled "This page intentionally left blank." Your code is also cleaner without the unnecessary closing tag.

    Unfortunately, HTML doesn't allow custom elements to be self-closing - only [official "void" elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/syntax.html#void-elements). That's why the strategy is only possible when Vue's template compiler can reach the template before the DOM, then serve the DOM spec-compliant HTML.

  description: |-
    ## Simple computed properties

    **Complex computed properties should be split into as many simpler properties as possible.**

    Detailed Explanation

    Simpler, well-named computed properties are:

    - **Easier to test**

      When each computed property contains only a very simple expression, with very few dependencies, it's much easier to write tests confirming that it works correctly.

    - **Easier to read**

      Simplifying computed properties forces you to give each value a descriptive name, even if it's not reused. This makes it much easier for other developers (and future you) to focus in on the code they care about and figure out what's going on.

    - **More adaptable to changing requirements**

      Any value that can be named might be useful to the view. For example, we might decide to display a message telling the user how much money they saved. We might also decide to calculate sales tax, but perhaps display it separately, rather than as part of the final price.

      Small, focused computed properties make fewer assumptions about how information will be used, so require less refactoring as requirements change.

    ### Bad

    ``` js
    computed: {
      price() {
        const basePrice = this.manufactureCost / (1 - this.profitMargin)
        return (
          basePrice -
          basePrice * (this.discountPercent || 0)
        )
      }
    }
    ```

    ``` js
    const price = computed(() => {
      const basePrice = manufactureCost.value / (1 - profitMargin.value)
      return basePrice - basePrice * (discountPercent.value || 0)
    })
    ```

    ### Good

    ``` js
    computed: {
      basePrice() {
        return this.manufactureCost / (1 - this.profitMargin)
      },

      discount() {
        return this.basePrice * (this.discountPercent || 0)
      },

      finalPrice() {
        return this.basePrice - this.discount
      }
    }
    ```

    ``` js
    const basePrice = computed(
      () => manufactureCost.value / (1 - profitMargin.value)
    )

    const discount = computed(
      () => basePrice.value * (discountPercent.value || 0)
    )

    const finalPrice = computed(() => basePrice.value - discount.value)

    ## Simple expressions in templates

    **Component templates should only include simple expressions, with more complex expressions refactored into computed properties or methods.**

    Complex expressions in your templates make them less declarative. We should strive to describe *what* should appear, not *how* we're computing that value. Computed properties and methods also allow the code to be reused.

    Detailed [prop definitions](../guide/components/props#prop-validation) have two advantages:

    - They document the API of the component, so that it's easy to see how the component is meant to be used.
    - In development, Vue will warn you if a component is ever provided incorrectly formatted props, helping you catch potential sources of error.

    ## Use keyed `v-for`

    `key` with `v-for` is *always* required on components, in order to maintain internal component state down the subtree. Even for elements though, it's a good practice to maintain predictable behavior, such as [object constancy](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/) in animations.

    Detailed Explanation

    Let's say you have a list of todos:

    ``` js
    data() {
      return {
        todos: [
          {
            id: 1,
            text: 'Learn to use v-for'
          },
          {
            id: 2,
            text: 'Learn to use key'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ``` js
    const todos = ref([
      {
        id: 1,
        text: 'Learn to use v-for'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        text: 'Learn to use key'
      }
    ])
    ```

    Then you sort them alphabetically. When updating the DOM, Vue will optimize rendering to perform the cheapest DOM mutations possible. That might mean deleting the first todo element, then adding it again at the end of the list.

    The problem is, there are cases where it's important not to delete elements that will remain in the DOM. For example, you may want to use `<transition-group>` to animate list sorting, or maintain focus if the rendered element is an `<input>`. In these cases, adding a unique key for each item (e.g. `:key="todo.id"`) will tell Vue how to behave more predictably.

    In our experience, it's better to *always* add a unique key, so that you and your team simply never have to worry about these edge cases. Then in the rare, performance-critical scenarios where object constancy isn't necessary, you can make a conscious exception.

    ### Bad

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <li v-for="todo in todos">
        {{ todo.text }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```

    ### Good

    ``` template
    <ul>
      <li
        v-for="todo in todos"
        :key="todo.id"
      >
        {{ todo.text }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```

    ## Use multi-word component names

    User component names should always be multi-word, except for root `App` components. This [prevents conflicts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name) with existing and future HTML elements, since all HTML elements are a single word.

    ### Bad

    ``` template
    <!-- in pre-compiled templates -->
    <Item />

    <!-- in in-DOM templates -->
    <item></item>
    ```

    ### Good

    ``` template
    <!-- in pre-compiled templates -->
    <TodoItem />

    <!-- in in-DOM templates -->
    <todo-item></todo-item>

  description: "# Utility Types\n\n**INFO**\n\nThis page only lists a few commonly used utility types that may need explanation for their usage. For a full list of exported types, consult the [source code](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/runtime-core/src/index.ts#L131).\n\n## PropType\\<T\\>\n\nUsed to annotate a prop with more advanced types when using runtime props declarations.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` ts\n  import type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\n  interface Book {\n    title: string\n    author: string\n    year: number\n  }\n\n  export default {\n    props: {\n      book: {\n        // provide more specific type to `Object`\n        type: Object as PropType<Book>,\n        required: true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Typing Component Props](../guide/typescript/options-api#typing-component-props)\n\n## MaybeRef\\<T\\>\n\nAlias for `T | Ref<T>`. Useful for annotating arguments of [Composables](../guide/reusability/composables).\n\n- Only supported in 3.3+.\n\n## MaybeRefOrGetter\\<T\\>\n\nAlias for `T | Ref<T> | (() => T)`. Useful for annotating arguments of [Composables](../guide/reusability/composables).\n\n- Only supported in 3.3+.\n\n## ExtractPropTypes\\<T\\>\n\nExtract prop types from a runtime props options object. The extracted types are internal facing - i.e. the resolved props received by the component. This means boolean props and props with default values are always defined, even if they are not required.\n\nTo extract public facing props, i.e. props that the parent is allowed to pass, use [`ExtractPublicPropTypes`](#extractpublicproptypes).\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` ts\n  const propsOptions = {\n    foo: String,\n    bar: Boolean,\n    baz: {\n      type: Number,\n      required: true\n    },\n    qux: {\n      type: Number,\n      default: 1\n    }\n  } as const\n\n  type Props = ExtractPropTypes<typeof propsOptions>\n  // {\n  //   foo?: string,\n  //   bar: boolean,\n  //   baz: number,\n  //   qux: number\n  // }\n  ```\n\n## ExtractPublicPropTypes\\<T\\>\n\nExtract prop types from a runtime props options object. The extracted types are public facing - i.e. the props that the parent is allowed to pass.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` ts\n  const propsOptions = {\n    foo: String,\n    bar: Boolean,\n    baz: {\n      type: Number,\n      required: true\n    },\n    qux: {\n      type: Number,\n      default: 1\n    }\n  } as const\n\n  type Props = ExtractPublicPropTypes<typeof propsOptions>\n  // {\n  //   foo?: string,\n  //   bar?: boolean,\n  //   baz: number,\n  //   qux?: number\n  // }\n  ```\n\n## ComponentCustomProperties\n\nUsed to augment the component instance type to support custom global properties.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` ts\n  import axios from 'axios'\n\n  declare module 'vue' {\n    interface ComponentCustomProperties {\n      $http: typeof axios\n      $translate: (key: string) => string\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **TIP**\n  Augmentations must be placed in a module `.ts` or `.d.ts` file. See [Type Augmentation Placement](../guide/typescript/options-api#augmenting-global-properties) for more details.\n\n- **See also** [Guide - Augmenting Global Properties](../guide/typescript/options-api#augmenting-global-properties)\n\n## ComponentCustomOptions\n\nUsed to augment the component options type to support custom options.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  ``` ts\n  import { Route } from 'vue-router'\n\n  declare module 'vue' {\n    interface ComponentCustomOptions {\n      beforeRouteEnter?(to: any, from: any, next: () => void): void\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **TIP**\n  Augmentations must be placed in a module `.ts` or `.d.ts` file.

See [Type Augmentation Placement](../guide/typescript/options-api#augmenting-global-properties) for more details.\n\n## CSSProperties\n\nUsed to augment allowed values in style property bindings.\n\n- **Example**\n\n  Allow any custom CSS property\n\n  ``` ts\n  declare module 'vue' {\n    interface CSSProperties {\n      [key: `--${string}`]: string\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ``` tsx\n  <div style={ { '--bg-color': 'blue' } }>\n  ```\n\n  ``` html\n  <div :style=\"{ '--bg-color': 'blue' }\"></div>\n  ```\n\n**TIP**\n\nAugmentations must be placed in a module `.ts` or `.d.ts` file. See [Type Augmentation Placement](../guide/typescript/options-api#augmenting-global-properties) for more details.\n\n**See also**\n\nSFC `<style>` tags support linking CSS values to dynamic component state using the `v-bind` CSS function. This allows for custom properties without type augmentation.\n\n- [v-bind() in CSS](sfc-css-features#v-bind-in-css)\n\n© 2013–present Yuxi Evan You  \nLicensed under the MIT License.  \n[https://vuejs.org/api/utility-types](https://vuejs.org/api/utility-types)"
