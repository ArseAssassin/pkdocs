    ### 2.5.1 – Arithmetic Operators

    Lua supports the usual arithmetic operators: the binary `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulo), and `^` (exponentiation); and unary `-` (negation). If the operands are numbers, or strings that can be converted to numbers (see [§2.2.1](#2.2.1)), then all operations have the usual meaning. Exponentiation works for any exponent. For instance, `x^(-0.5)` computes the inverse of the square root of `x`. Modulo is defined as

    ```
    a % b == a - math.floor(a/b)*b
    ```

    That is, it is the remainder of a division that rounds the quotient towards minus infinity.
- name: assert()
  summary: ''
  description: |-
    ### `assert (v [, message])`

    Issues an error when the value of its argument `v` is false (i.e., **nil** or **false**); otherwise, returns all its arguments. `message` is an error message; when absent, it defaults to "assertion failed!"
- name: Assignment
  summary: Lua allows multiple assignments
  description: |-
    ### 2.4.3 – Assignment

    Lua allows multiple assignments. Therefore, the syntax for assignment defines a list of variables on the left side and a list of expressions on the right side. The elements in both lists are separated by commas:

    ```
    stat ::= varlist `=´ explist
    varlist ::= var {`,´ var}
    explist ::= exp {`,´ exp}
    ```

    Expressions are discussed in [§2.5](#2.5).

    Before the assignment, the list of values is *adjusted* to the length of the list of variables. If there are more values than needed, the excess values are thrown away. If there are fewer values than needed, the list is extended with as many **nil**'s as needed. If the list of expressions ends with a function call, then all values returned by that call enter the list of values, before the adjustment (except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see [§2.5](#2.5)).

    The assignment statement first evaluates all its expressions and only then are the assignments performed. Thus the code

    ```
    i = 3
    i, a[i] = i+1, 20
    ```

    sets `a[3]` to 20, without affecting `a[4]` because the `i` in `a[i]` is evaluated (to 3) before it is assigned 4. Similarly, the line

    ```
    x, y = y, x
    ```

    exchanges the values of `x` and `y`, and

    ```
    x, y, z = y, z, x
    ```

    cyclically permutes the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    The meaning of assignments to global variables and table fields can be changed via metatables. An assignment to an indexed variable `t[i] = val` is equivalent to `settable_event(t,i,val)`. (See [§2.8](#2.8) for a complete description of the `settable_event` function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)

    An assignment to a global variable `x = val` is equivalent to the assignment `_env.x = val`, which in turn is equivalent to

    ```
    settable_event(_env, "x", val)
    ```

    where `_env` is the environment of the running function. (The `_env` variable is not defined in Lua. We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)
- name: Blocks
  summary: 'A block is a list of statements; syntactically, a block is the same as a chunk:'
  description: |-
    ### 2.4.2 – Blocks

    A block is a list of statements; syntactically, a block is the same as a chunk:

    ```
    block ::= chunk
    ```

    A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:

    ```
    stat ::= do block end
    ```

    Explicit blocks are useful to control the scope of variable declarations. Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to add a **return** or **break** statement in the middle of another block (see [§2.4.4](#2.4.4)).
- name: Chunks
  summary: The unit of execution of Lua is called a chunk
  description: |-
    ### 2.4.1 – Chunks

    The unit of execution of Lua is called a *chunk*. A chunk is simply a sequence of statements, which are executed sequentially. Each statement can be optionally followed by a semicolon:

    ```
    chunk ::= {stat [`;´]}
    ```

    There are no empty statements and thus '`;;`' is not legal.

    Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function with a variable number of arguments (see [§2.5.9](#2.5.9)). As such, chunks can define local variables, receive arguments, and return values.

    A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program. To execute a chunk, Lua first pre-compiles the chunk into instructions for a virtual machine, and then it executes the compiled code with an interpreter for the virtual machine.

    Chunks can also be pre-compiled into binary form; see program `luac` for details. Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable; Lua automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly.
- name: Coercion
  summary: Lua provides automatic conversion between string and number values at run time
  description: |-
    ### 2.2.1 – Coercion

    Lua provides automatic conversion between string and number values at run time. Any arithmetic operation applied to a string tries to convert this string to a number, following the usual conversion rules. Conversely, whenever a number is used where a string is expected, the number is converted to a string, in a reasonable format. For complete control over how numbers are converted to strings, use the `format` function from the string library (see [`string.format`](#pdf-string.format)).
- name: collectgarbage()
  summary: This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector
  description: |-
    ### `collectgarbage ([opt [, arg]])`

    This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector. It performs different functions according to its first argument, `opt`:

    - **"collect":** performs a full garbage-collection cycle. This is the default option.
    - **"stop":** stops the garbage collector.
    - **"restart":** restarts the garbage collector.
    - **"count":** returns the total memory in use by Lua (in Kbytes).
    - **"step":** performs a garbage-collection step. The step "size" is controlled by `arg` (larger values mean more steps) in a non-specified way. If you want to control the step size you must experimentally tune the value of `arg`. Returns **true** if the step finished a collection cycle.
    - **"setpause":** sets `arg` as the new value for the *pause* of the collector (see [§2.10](#2.10)). Returns the previous value for *pause*.
    - **"setstepmul":** sets `arg` as the new value for the *step multiplier* of the collector (see [§2.10](#2.10)). Returns the previous value for *step*.
- name: Concatenation
  summary: The string concatenation operator in Lua is denoted by two dots ('..')
  description: |-
    ### 2.5.4 – Concatenation

    The string concatenation operator in Lua is denoted by two dots ('`..`'). If both operands are strings or numbers, then they are converted to strings according to the rules mentioned in [§2.2.1](#2.2.1). Otherwise, the "concat" metamethod is called (see [§2.8](#2.8)).
- name: Control Structures
  summary: 'The control structures if, while, and repeat have the usual meaning and familiar syntax:'
  description: |-
    ### 2.4.4 – Control Structures

    The control structures **if**, **while**, and **repeat** have the usual meaning and familiar syntax:

    ```
    stat ::= while exp do block end
    stat ::= repeat block until exp
    stat ::= if exp then block {elseif exp then block} [else block] end
    ```

    Lua also has a **for** statement, in two flavors (see [§2.4.5](#2.4.5)).

    The condition expression of a control structure can return any value. Both **false** and **nil** are considered false. All values different from **nil** and **false** are considered true (in particular, the number 0 and the empty string are also true).

    In the **repeat**–**until** loop, the inner block does not end at the **until** keyword, but only after the condition. So, the condition can refer to local variables declared inside the loop block.

    The **return** statement is used to return values from a function or a chunk (which is just a function). Functions and chunks can return more than one value, and so the syntax for the **return** statement is

    ```
    stat ::= return [explist]
    ```

    The **break** statement is used to terminate the execution of a **while**, **repeat**, or **for** loop, skipping to the next statement after the loop:

    ```
    stat ::= break
    ```

    A **break** ends the innermost enclosing loop.

    The **return** and **break** statements can only be written as the *last* statement of a block. If it is really necessary to **return** or **break** in the middle of a block, then an explicit inner block can be used, as in the idioms `do return end` and `do break end`, because now **return** and **break** are the last statements in their (inner) blocks.
- name: coroutine.create()
  summary: Creates a new coroutine, with body f
  description: |-
    ### `coroutine.create (f)`

    Creates a new coroutine, with body `f`. `f` must be a Lua function. Returns this new coroutine, an object with type `"thread"`.
- name: coroutine.resume()
  summary: Starts or continues the execution of coroutine co
  description: |-
    ### `coroutine.resume (co [, val1, ···])`

    Starts or continues the execution of coroutine `co`. The first time you resume a coroutine, it starts running its body. The values `val1`, ··· are passed as the arguments to the body function. If the coroutine has yielded, `resume` restarts it; the values `val1`, ··· are passed as the results from the yield.

    If the coroutine runs without any errors, `resume` returns **true** plus any values passed to `yield` (if the coroutine yields) or any values returned by the body function (if the coroutine terminates). If there is any error, `resume` returns **false** plus the error message.
- name: coroutine.running()
  summary: Returns the running coroutine, or nil when called by the main thread
  description: |-
    ### `coroutine.running ()`

    Returns the running coroutine, or **nil** when called by the main thread.
- name: coroutine.status()
  summary: 'Returns the status of coroutine co, as a string: "running", if the coroutine is running (that is, it called status); "suspended", if the coroutine is suspended in a call to yield, or if it has not started running yet; "normal" if the coroutine is active but not running (that is, it has resumed another coroutine); and "dead" if the coroutine has finished its body function, or if it has stopped with an error'
  description: |-
    ### `coroutine.status (co)`

    Returns the status of coroutine `co`, as a string: `"running"`, if the coroutine is running (that is, it called `status`); `"suspended"`, if the coroutine is suspended in a call to `yield`, or if it has not started running yet; `"normal"` if the coroutine is active but not running (that is, it has resumed another coroutine); and `"dead"` if the coroutine has finished its body function, or if it has stopped with an error.
- name: coroutine.wrap()
  summary: Creates a new coroutine, with body f
  description: |-
    ### `coroutine.wrap (f)`

    Creates a new coroutine, with body `f`. `f` must be a Lua function. Returns a function that resumes the coroutine each time it is called. Any arguments passed to the function behave as the extra arguments to `resume`. Returns the same values returned by `resume`, except the first boolean. In case of error, propagates the error.
- name: coroutine.yield()
  summary: Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine
  description: |-
    ### `coroutine.yield (···)`

    Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine. The coroutine cannot be running a C function, a metamethod, or an iterator. Any arguments to `yield` are passed as extra results to `resume`.
- name: Coroutines
  summary: Lua supports coroutines, also called collaborative multithreading
  description: "## 2.11 – Coroutines\n\nLua supports coroutines, also called *collaborative multithreading*. A coroutine in Lua represents an independent thread of execution. Unlike threads in multithread systems, however, a coroutine only suspends its execution by explicitly calling a yield function.\n\nYou create a coroutine with a call to [`coroutine.create`](#pdf-coroutine.create). Its sole argument is a function that is the main function of the coroutine. The `create` function only creates a new coroutine and returns a handle to it (an object of type *thread*); it does not start the coroutine execution.\n\nWhen you first call [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume), passing as its first argument a thread returned by [`coroutine.create`](#pdf-coroutine.create), the coroutine starts its execution, at the first line of its main function. Extra arguments passed to [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume) are passed on to the coroutine main function. After the coroutine starts running, it runs until it terminates or *yields*.\n\nA coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways: normally, when its main function returns (explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction); and abnormally, if there is an unprotected error. In the first case, [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume) returns **true**, plus any values returned by the coroutine main function. In case of errors, [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume) returns **false** plus an error message.\n\nA coroutine yields by calling [`coroutine.yield`](#pdf-coroutine.yield). When a coroutine yields, the corresponding [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume) returns immediately, even if the yield happens inside nested function calls (that is, not in the main function, but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main function). In the case of a yield, [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume) also returns **true**, plus any values passed to [`coroutine.yield`](#pdf-coroutine.yield). The next time you resume the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it yielded, with the call to [`coroutine.yield`](#pdf-coroutine.yield) returning any extra arguments passed to [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume).\n\nLike [`coroutine.create`](#pdf-coroutine.create), the [`coroutine.wrap`](#pdf-coroutine.wrap) function also creates a coroutine, but instead of returning the coroutine itself, it returns a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine. Any arguments passed to this function go as extra arguments to [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume). [`coroutine.wrap`](#pdf-coroutine.wrap) returns all the values returned by [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume), except the first one (the boolean error code). Unlike [`coroutine.resume`](#pdf-coroutine.resume), [`coroutine.wrap`](#pdf-coroutine.wrap) does not catch errors; any error is propagated to the caller.\n\nAs an example, consider the following code:\n\n```\nfunction foo (a)\n  print(\"foo\", a)\n  return coroutine.yield(2*a)\nend\n\nco = coroutine.create(function (a,b)\n      print(\"co-body\", a, b)\n      local r = foo(a+1)\n      print(\"co-body\", r)\n      local r, s = coroutine.yield(a+b, a-b)\n      print(\"co-body\", r, s)\n      return b, \"end\"\nend)\n       \nprint(\"main\", coroutine.resume(co, 1, 10))\nprint(\"main\", coroutine.resume(co, \"r\"))\nprint(\"main\", coroutine.resume(co, \"x\", \"y\"))\nprint(\"main\", coroutine.resume(co, \"x\", \"y\"))\n```\n\nWhen you run it, it produces the following output:\n\n```\nco-body 1       10\nfoo     2\n\nmain    true    4\nco-body r\nmain    true    11      -9\nco-body x       y\nmain    true    10      end\nmain    false   cannot resume dead coroutine\n```"

  summary: Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that the user enters
  description: |-
    ### `debug.debug ()`

    Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that the user enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities, the user can inspect global and local variables, change their values, evaluate expressions, and so on. A line containing only the word `cont` finishes this function, so that the caller continues its execution.

    Note that commands for `debug.debug` are not lexically nested within any function, and so have no direct access to local variables.

  description: |-
    ### `debug.gethook ([thread])`

    Returns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the current hook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count (as set by the [`debug.sethook`](#pdf-debug.sethook) function).
- name: debug.getinfo()
  summary: Returns a table with information about a function
  description: |-
    ### `debug.getinfo ([thread,] function [, what])`

    Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the function directly, or you can give a number as the value of `function`, which means the function running at level `function` of the call stack of the given thread: level 0 is the current function (`getinfo` itself); level 1 is the function that called `getinfo`; and so on. If `function` is a number larger than the number of active functions, then `getinfo` returns **nil**.

    The returned table can contain all the fields returned by [`lua_getinfo`](#lua_getinfo), with the string `what` describing which fields to fill in. The default for `what` is to get all information available, except the table of valid lines. If present, the option '`f`' adds a field named `func` with the function itself. If present, the option '`L`' adds a field named `activelines` with the table of valid lines.

    For instance, the expression `debug.getinfo(1,"n").name` returns a table with a name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found, and the expression `debug.getinfo(print)` returns a table with all available information about the [`print`](#pdf-print) function.
- name: debug.getlocal()
  summary: This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with index local of the function at level level of the stack
  description: |-
    ### `debug.getlocal ([thread,] level, local)`

    This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with index `local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. (The first parameter or local variable has index 1, and so on, until the last active local variable.) The function returns **nil** if there is no local variable with the given index, and raises an error when called with a `level` out of range. (You can call [`debug.getinfo`](#pdf-debug.getinfo) to check whether the level is valid.)

    Variable names starting with '`(`' (open parentheses) represent internal variables (loop control variables, temporaries, and C function locals).
- name: debug.getmetatable()
  summary: Returns the metatable of the given object or nil if it does not have a metatable
  description: |-
    ### `debug.getmetatable (object)`

    Returns the metatable of the given `object` or **nil** if it does not have a metatable.
- name: debug.getregistry()
  summary: Returns the registry table (see §3.5)
  description: |-
    ### `debug.getregistry ()`

    Returns the registry table (see [§3.5](#3.5)).
- name: debug.getupvalue()
  summary: This function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index up of the function func
  description: |-
    ### `debug.getupvalue (func, up)`

    This function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index `up` of the function `func`. The function returns **nil** if there is no upvalue with the given index.
- name: debug.setfenv()
  summary: Sets the environment of the given object to the given table
  description: |-
    ### `debug.setfenv (object, table)`

    Sets the environment of the given `object` to the given `table`. Returns `object`.
- name: debug.sethook()
  summary: Sets the given function as a hook
  description: |-
    ### `debug.sethook ([thread,] hook, mask [, count])`

    Sets the given function as a hook. The string `mask` and the number `count` describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have the following characters, with the given meaning:

    - `"c"`: the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;
    - `"r"`: the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;
    - `"l"`: the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.

    With a `count` different from zero, the hook is called after every `count` instructions.

    When called without arguments, [`debug.sethook`](#pdf-debug.sethook) turns off the hook.

    When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing the event that has triggered its call: `"call"`, `"return"` (or `"tail return"`, when simulating a return from a tail call), `"line"`, and `"count"`. For line events, the hook also gets the new line number as its second parameter. Inside a hook, you can call `getinfo` with level 2 to get more information about the running function (level 0 is the `getinfo` function, and level 1 is the hook function), unless the event is `"tail return"`. In this case, Lua is only simulating the return, and a call to `getinfo` will return invalid data.
- name: debug.setlocal()
  summary: This function assigns the value value to the local variable with index local of the function at level level of the stack
  description: |-
    ### `debug.setlocal ([thread,] level, local, value)`

    This function assigns the value `value` to the local variable with index `local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. The function returns **nil** if there is no local variable with the given index, and raises an error when called with a `level` out of range. (You can call `getinfo` to check whether the level is valid.) Otherwise, it returns the name of the local variable.
- name: debug.setmetatable()

  description: |-
    ### `debug.setupvalue (func, up, value)`

    This function assigns the value `value` to the upvalue with index `up` of the function `func`. The function returns **nil** if there is no upvalue with the given index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.
- name: debug.traceback()

  description: |-
    ### `debug.traceback ([thread,] [message [, level]])`

    ### `dofile ([filename])`

    Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When called without arguments, `dofile` executes the contents of the standard input (`stdin`). Returns all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors, `dofile` propagates the error to its caller (that is, `dofile` does not run in protected mode).
- name: Environments
  summary: Besides metatables, objects of types thread, function, and userdata have another table associated with them, called their environment
  description: |-
    ## 2.9 – Environments

    Besides metatables, objects of types thread, function, and userdata have another table associated with them, called their *environment*. Like metatables, environments are regular tables and multiple objects can share the same environment.

    Threads are created sharing the environment of the creating thread. Userdata and C functions are created sharing the environment of the creating C function. Non-nested Lua functions (created by [`loadfile`](#pdf-loadfile), [`loadstring`](#pdf-loadstring) or [`load`](#pdf-load)) are created sharing the environment of the creating thread. Nested Lua functions are created sharing the environment of the creating Lua function.

    Environments associated with userdata have no meaning for Lua. It is only a convenience feature for programmers to associate a table to a userdata.

    Environments associated with threads are called *global environments*. They are used as the default environment for threads and non-nested Lua functions created by the thread and can be directly accessed by C code (see [§3.3](#3.3)).

    The environment associated with a C function can be directly accessed by C code (see [§3.3](#3.3)). It is used as the default environment for other C functions and userdata created by the function.

    Environments associated with Lua functions are used to resolve all accesses to global variables within the function (see [§2.3](#2.3)). They are used as the default environment for nested Lua functions created by the function.

    You can change the environment of a Lua function or the running thread by calling [`setfenv`](#pdf-setfenv). You can get the environment of a Lua function or the running thread by calling [`getfenv`](#pdf-getfenv). To manipulate the environment of other objects (userdata, C functions, other threads) you must use the C API.
- name: Error Handling
  summary: Because Lua is an embedded extension language, all Lua actions start from C code in the host program calling a function from the Lua library (see lua_pcall)
  description: |-
    ## 2.7 – Error Handling

    Because Lua is an embedded extension language, all Lua actions start from C code in the host program calling a function from the Lua library (see [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall)). Whenever an error occurs during Lua compilation or execution, control returns to C, which can take appropriate measures (such as printing an error message).

    Lua code can explicitly generate an error by calling the [`error`](#pdf-error) function. If you need to catch errors in Lua, you can use the [`pcall`](#pdf-pcall) function.
- name: error()
  summary: Usually, error adds some information about the error position at the beginning of the message
  description: |-
    ### `error (message [, level])`

    Terminates the last protected function called and returns `message` as the error message. Function `error` never returns.

    Usually, `error` adds some information about the error position at the beginning of the message. The `level` argument specifies how to get the error position. With level 1 (the default), the error position is where the `error` function was called. Level 2 points the error to where the function that called `error` was called; and so on. Passing a level 0 avoids the addition of error position information to the message.
- name: Expressions
  summary: 'The basic expressions in Lua are the following:'
  description: |-
    ## 2.5 – Expressions

    The basic expressions in Lua are the following:

    ```
    exp ::= prefixexp
    exp ::= nil | false | true
    exp ::= Number
    exp ::= String
    exp ::= function
    exp ::= tableconstructor
    exp ::= `...´
    exp ::= exp binop exp
    exp ::= unop exp
    prefixexp ::= var | functioncall | `(´ exp `)´
    ```

    Numbers and literal strings are explained in [§2.1](#2.1); variables are explained in [§2.3](#2.3); function definitions are explained in [§2.5.9](#2.5.9); function calls are explained in [§2.5.8](#2.5.8); table constructors are explained in [§2.5.7](#2.5.7). Vararg expressions, denoted by three dots ('`...`'), can only be used when directly inside a vararg function; they are explained in [§2.5.9](#2.5.9).

    Binary operators comprise arithmetic operators (see [§2.5.1](#2.5.1)), relational operators (see [§2.5.2](#2.5.2)), logical operators (see [§2.5.3](#2.5.3)), and the concatenation operator (see [§2.5.4](#2.5.4)). Unary operators comprise the unary minus (see [§2.5.1](#2.5.1)), the unary **not** (see [§2.5.3](#2.5.3)), and the unary *length operator* (see [§2.5.5](#2.5.5)).

    Both function calls and vararg expressions can result in multiple values. If an expression is used as a statement (only possible for function calls (see [§2.4.6](#2.4.6))), then its return list is adjusted to zero elements, thus discarding all returned values. If an expression is used as the last (or the only) element of a list of expressions, then no adjustment is made (unless the call is enclosed in parentheses). In all other contexts, Lua adjusts the result list to one element, discarding all values except the first one.

    Here are some examples:

    ```
    f()                -- adjusted to 0 results
    g(f(), x)          -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
    g(x, f())          -- g gets x plus all results from f()
    a,b,c = f(), x     -- f() is adjusted to 1 result (c gets nil)
    a,b = ...          -- a gets the first vararg parameter, b gets
                       -- the second (both a and b can get nil if there
                       -- is no corresponding vararg parameter)

    a,b,c = x, f()     -- f() is adjusted to 2 results
    a,b,c = f()        -- f() is adjusted to 3 results
    return f()         -- returns all results from f()
    return ...         -- returns all received vararg parameters
    return x,y,f()     -- returns x, y, and all results from f()
    {f()}              -- creates a list with all results from f()
    {...}              -- creates a list with all vararg parameters
    {f(), nil}         -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
    ```

    Any expression enclosed in parentheses always results in only one value. Thus, `(f(x,y,z))` is always a single value, even if `f` returns several values. (The value of `(f(x,y,z))` is the first value returned by `f` or **nil** if `f` does not return any values.)

For each format, the function returns a string (or a number) with the characters read, or **nil** if it cannot read data with the specified format. When called without formats, it uses a default format that reads the entire next line (see below).

    The available formats are

    - **"\*n":** reads a number; this is the only format that returns a number instead of a string.
    - **"\*a":** reads the whole file, starting at the current position. On end of file, it returns the empty string.
    - **"\*l":** reads the next line (skipping the end of line), returning **nil** on end of file. This is the default format.
    - ***number*:** reads a string with up to this number of characters, returning **nil** on end of file. If number is zero, it reads nothing and returns an empty string, or **nil** on end of file.

    Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the file, to the position given by `offset` plus a base specified by the string `whence`, as follows:

    - **"cur":** base is current position;
    - **"end":** base is end of file;

    In case of success, function `seek` returns the final file position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file. If this function fails, it returns **nil**, plus a string describing the error.

    The default value for `whence` is `"cur"`, and for `offset` is 0. Therefore, the call `file:seek()` returns the current file position, without changing it; the call `file:seek("set")` sets the position to the beginning of the file (and returns 0); and the call `file:seek("end")` sets the position to the end of the file, and returns its size.

- name: For Statement
  summary: 'The for statement has two forms: one numeric and one generic'
  description: |-
    ### 2.4.5 – For Statement

    The **for** statement has two forms: one numeric and one generic.

    The numeric **for** loop repeats a block of code while a control variable runs through an arithmetic progression. It has the following syntax:

    ```
    stat ::= for Name `=´ exp `,´ exp [`,´ exp] do block end
    ```

    The *block* is repeated for *name* starting at the value of the first *exp*, until it passes the second *exp* by steps of the third *exp*. More precisely, a **for** statement like

    ```
    for v = e1, e2, e3 do block end
    ```

    is equivalent to the code:

    ```
    do
      local var, limit, step = tonumber(e1), tonumber(e2), tonumber(e3)
      if not (var and limit and step) then error() end
      while (step > 0 and var <= limit) or (step <= 0 and var >= limit) do
        local v = var
        block
        var = var + step
      end
    end
    ```

    Note the following:

    - All three control expressions are evaluated only once, before the loop starts. They must all result in numbers.
    - *`var`*, *`limit`*, and *`step`* are invisible variables. The names shown here are for explanatory purposes only.
    - If the third expression (the step) is absent, then a step of 1 is used.
    - You can use **break** to exit a **for** loop.
    - The loop variable `v` is local to the loop; you cannot use its value after the **for** ends or is broken. If you need this value, assign it to another variable before breaking or exiting the loop.

    The generic **for** statement works over functions, called *iterators*. On each iteration, the iterator function is called to produce a new value, stopping when this new value is **nil**. The generic **for** loop has the following syntax:

    ```
    stat ::= for namelist in explist do block end
    namelist ::= Name {`,´ Name}
    ```

    A **for** statement like

    ```
    for var_1, ···, var_n in explist do block end
    ```

    is equivalent to the code:

    ```
    do
      local f, s, var = explist
      while true do
        local var_1, ···, var_n = f(s, var)
        var = var_1
        if var == nil then break end
        block
      end
    end
    ```

    Note the following:

    - *`explist`* is evaluated only once. Its results are an *iterator* function, a *state*, and an initial value for the first *iterator variable*.
    - *`f`*, *`s`*, and *`var`* are invisible variables. The names are here for explanatory purposes only.
    - You can use **break** to exit a **for** loop.
    - The loop variables *`var_i`* are local to the loop; you cannot use their values after the **for** ends. If you need these values, then assign them to other variables before breaking or exiting the loop.
- name: Function Calls
  summary: 'A function call in Lua has the following syntax:'
  description: |-
    ### 2.5.8 – Function Calls

    A function call in Lua has the following syntax:

    ```
    functioncall ::= prefixexp args
    ```

    In a function call, first prefixexp and args are evaluated. If the value of prefixexp has type *function*, then this function is called with the given arguments. Otherwise, the prefixexp "call" metamethod is called, having as first parameter the value of prefixexp, followed by the original call arguments (see [§2.8](#2.8)).

    The form

    ```
    functioncall ::= prefixexp `:´ Name args
    ```

    can be used to call "methods". A call `v:name(`*`args`*`)` is syntactic sugar for `v.name(v,`*`args`*`)`, except that `v` is evaluated only once.

    Arguments have the following syntax:

    ```
    args ::= `(´ [explist] `)´
    args ::= tableconstructor
    args ::= String
    ```

    All argument expressions are evaluated before the call. A call of the form `f{`*`fields`*`}` is syntactic sugar for `f({`*`fields`*`})`; that is, the argument list is a single new table. A call of the form `f'`*`string`*`'` (or `f"`*`string`*`"` or `f[[`*`string`*`]]`) is syntactic sugar for `f('`*`string`*`')`; that is, the argument list is a single literal string.

    As an exception to the free-format syntax of Lua, you cannot put a line break before the '`(`' in a function call. This restriction avoids some ambiguities in the language. If you write

    ```
    a = f
    (g).x(a)
    ```

    Lua would see that as a single statement, `a = f(g).x(a)`. So, if you want two statements, you must add a semi-colon between them. If you actually want to call `f`, you must remove the line break before `(g)`.

    A call of the form `return` *functioncall* is called a *tail call*. Lua implements *proper tail calls* (or *proper tail recursion*): in a tail call, the called function reuses the stack entry of the calling function. Therefore, there is no limit on the number of nested tail calls that a program can execute. However, a tail call erases any debug information about the calling function. Note that a tail call only happens with a particular syntax, where the **return** has one single function call as argument; this syntax makes the calling function return exactly the returns of the called function. So, none of the following examples are tail calls:

    ```
    return (f(x))        -- results adjusted to 1
    return 2 * f(x)
    return x, f(x)       -- additional results
    f(x); return         -- results discarded
    return x or f(x)     -- results adjusted to 1
    ```

  description: |-
    ### 2.4.6 – Function Calls as Statements

    To allow possible side-effects, function calls can be executed as statements:

    ```
    stat ::= functioncall
    ```

    In this case, all returned values are thrown away. Function calls are explained in [§2.5.8](#2.5.8).
- name: Function Definitions
  summary: The syntax for function definition is
  description: |-
    ### 2.5.9 – Function Definitions

    The syntax for function definition is

    ```
    function ::= function funcbody
    funcbody ::= `(´ [parlist] `)´ block end
    ```

    The following syntactic sugar simplifies function definitions:

    ```
    stat ::= function funcname funcbody
    stat ::= local function Name funcbody
    funcname ::= Name {`.´ Name} [`:´ Name]
    ```

    The statement

    ```
    function f () body end
    ```

    translates to

    ```
    f = function () body end
    ```

    The statement

    ```
    function t.a.b.c.f () body end
    ```

    translates to

    ```
    t.a.b.c.f = function () body end
    ```

    The statement

    ```
    local function f () body end
    ```

    translates to

    ```
    local f; f = function () body end
    ```

    *not* to

    ```
    local f = function () body end
    ```

    (This only makes a difference when the body of the function contains references to `f`.)

    A function definition is an executable expression, whose value has type *function*. When Lua pre-compiles a chunk, all its function bodies are pre-compiled too. Then, whenever Lua executes the function definition, the function is *instantiated* (or *closed*). This function instance (or *closure*) is the final value of the expression. Different instances of the same function can refer to different external local variables and can have different environment tables.

    Parameters act as local variables that are initialized with the argument values:

    ```
    parlist ::= namelist [`,´ `...´] | `...´
    ```

    When a function is called, the list of arguments is adjusted to the length of the list of parameters, unless the function is a variadic or *vararg function*, which is indicated by three dots ('`...`') at the end of its parameter list. A vararg function does not adjust its argument list; instead, it collects all extra arguments and supplies them to the function through a *vararg expression*, which is also written as three dots. The value of this expression is a list of all actual extra arguments, similar to a function with multiple results. If a vararg expression is used inside another expression or in the middle of a list of expressions, then its return list is adjusted to one element. If the expression is used as the last element of a list of expressions, then no adjustment is made (unless that last expression is enclosed in parentheses).

    As an example, consider the following definitions:

    ```
    function f(a, b) end
    function g(a, b, ...) end
    function r() return 1,2,3 end
    ```

    Then, we have the following mapping from arguments to parameters and to the vararg expression:

    ```
    CALL            PARAMETERS

    f(3)             a=3, b=nil
    f(3, 4)          a=3, b=4
    f(3, 4, 5)       a=3, b=4
    f(r(), 10)       a=1, b=10
    f(r())           a=1, b=2

    g(3)             a=3, b=nil, ... -->  (nothing)
    g(3, 4)          a=3, b=4,   ... -->  (nothing)
    g(3, 4, 5, 8)    a=3, b=4,   ... -->  5  8
    g(5, r())        a=5, b=1,   ... -->  2  3
    ```

    Results are returned using the **return** statement (see [§2.4.4](#2.4.4)). If control reaches the end of a function without encountering a **return** statement, then the function returns with no results.

    The *colon* syntax is used for defining *methods*, that is, functions that have an implicit extra parameter `self`. Thus, the statement

    ```
    function t.a.b.c:f (params) body end
    ```

    is syntactic sugar for

    ```
    t.a.b.c.f = function (self, params) body end
    ```
- name: Garbage Collection
  summary: Lua performs automatic memory management
  description: |-
    ## 2.10 – Garbage Collection

    Lua performs automatic memory management. This means that you have to worry neither about allocating memory for new objects nor about freeing it when the objects are no longer needed. Lua manages memory automatically by running a *garbage collector* from time to time to collect all *dead objects* (that is, objects that are no longer accessible from Lua). All memory used by Lua is subject to automatic management: tables, userdata, functions, threads, strings, etc.

    Lua implements an incremental mark-and-sweep collector. It uses two numbers to control its garbage-collection cycles: the *garbage-collector pause* and the *garbage-collector step multiplier*. Both use percentage points as units (so that a value of 100 means an internal value of 1).

    The garbage-collector pause controls how long the collector waits before starting a new cycle. Larger values make the collector less aggressive. Values smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to start a new cycle. A value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use to double before starting a new cycle.

    The step multiplier controls the relative speed of the collector relative to memory allocation. Larger values make the collector more aggressive but also increase the size of each incremental step. Values smaller than 100 make the collector too slow and can result in the collector never finishing a cycle. The default, 200, means that the collector runs at "twice" the speed of memory allocation.

    You can change these numbers by calling [`lua_gc`](#lua_gc) in C or [`collectgarbage`](#pdf-collectgarbage) in Lua. With these functions you can also control the collector directly (e.g., stop and restart it).
- name: Garbage-Collection Metamethods
  summary: Using the C API, you can set garbage-collector metamethods for userdata (see §2.8)
  description: |-
    ### 2.10.1 – Garbage-Collection Metamethods

    Using the C API, you can set garbage-collector metamethods for userdata (see [§2.8](#2.8)). These metamethods are also called *finalizers*. Finalizers allow you to coordinate Lua's garbage collection with external resource management (such as closing files, network or database connections, or freeing your own memory).

    Garbage userdata with a field `__gc` in their metatables are not collected immediately by the garbage collector. Instead, Lua puts them in a list. After the collection, Lua does the equivalent of the following function for each userdata in that list:

    ```
    function gc_event (udata)
      local h = metatable(udata).__gc
      if h then
        h(udata)
      end
    end
    ```

    At the end of each garbage-collection cycle, the finalizers for userdata are called in *reverse* order of their creation, among those collected in that cycle. That is, the first finalizer to be called is the one associated with the userdata created last in the program. The userdata itself is freed only in the next garbage-collection cycle.

  summary: Names (also called identifiers) in Lua can be any string of letters, digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit

    ## 2.1 – Lexical Conventions

    *Names* (also called *identifiers*) in Lua can be any string of letters, digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit. This coincides with the definition of names in most languages. (The definition of letter depends on the current locale: any character considered alphabetic by the current locale can be used in an identifier.) Identifiers are used to name variables and table fields.

    The following *keywords* are reserved and cannot be used as names:

    ```
    and       break     do        else      elseif
    end       false     for       function  if
    in        local     nil       not       or
    repeat    return    then      true      until     while
    ```

    Lua is a case-sensitive language: `and` is a reserved word, but `And` and `AND` are two different, valid names. As a convention, names starting with an underscore followed by uppercase letters (such as [`_VERSION`](#pdf-_VERSION)) are reserved for internal global variables used by Lua.

    The following strings denote other tokens:

    ```
    +     -     *     /     %     ^     #
    ==    ~=    <=    >=    <     >     =

    *Literal strings* can be delimited by matching single or double quotes, and can contain the following C-like escape sequences: '`\a`' (bell), '`\b`' (backspace), '`\f`' (form feed), '`\n`' (newline), '`\r`' (carriage return), '`\t`' (horizontal tab), '`\v`' (vertical tab), '`\\`' (backslash), '`\"`' (quotation mark \[double quote\]), and '`\'`' (apostrophe \[single quote\]). Moreover, a backslash followed by a real newline results in a newline in the string. A character in a string can also be specified by its numerical value using the escape sequence `\`*`ddd`*, where *ddd* is a sequence of up to three decimal digits. (Note that if a numerical escape is to be followed by a digit, it must be expressed using exactly three digits.) Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros, which can be specified as '`\0`'.

    Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by *long brackets*. We define an *opening long bracket of level *n** as an opening square bracket followed by *n* equal signs followed by another opening square bracket. So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as `[[`, an opening long bracket of level 1 is written as `[=[`, and so on. A *closing long bracket* is defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written as `]====]`. A long string starts with an opening long bracket of any level and ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level. Literals in this bracketed form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape sequences, and ignore long brackets of any other level. They can contain anything except a closing bracket of the proper level.

    For convenience, when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a newline, the newline is not included in the string. As an example, in a system using ASCII (in which '`a`' is coded as 97, newline is coded as 10, and '`1`' is coded as 49), the five literal strings below denote the same string:

    ```
    a = 'alo\n123"'
    a = "alo\n123\""
    a = '\97lo\10\04923"'
    a = [[alo
    123"]]
    a = [==[
    alo
    123"]==]
    ```

    A *numerical constant* can be written with an optional decimal part and an optional decimal exponent. Lua also accepts integer hexadecimal constants, by prefixing them with `0x`. Examples of valid numerical constants are

    ```
    3   3.0   3.1416   314.16e-2   0.31416E1   0xff   0x56
    ```

    A *comment* starts with a double hyphen (`--`) anywhere outside a string. If the text immediately after `--` is not an opening long bracket, the comment is a *short comment*, which runs until the end of the line. Otherwise, it is a *long comment*, which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket. Long comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily.
- name: load()
  summary: Loads a chunk using function func to get its pieces
  description: |-
    ### `load (func [, chunkname])`

    Loads a chunk using function `func` to get its pieces. Each call to `func` must return a string that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty string, **nil**, or no value signals the end of the chunk.

    If there are no errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function; otherwise, returns **nil** plus the error message. The environment of the returned function is the global environment.

    `chunkname` is used as the chunk name for error messages and debug information. When absent, it defaults to "`=(load)`".

- name: Local Declarations
  summary: Local variables can be declared anywhere inside a block
  description: |-
    ### 2.4.7 – Local Declarations

    Local variables can be declared anywhere inside a block. The declaration can include an initial assignment:

    ```
    stat ::= local namelist [`=´ explist]
    ```

    If present, an initial assignment has the same semantics of a multiple assignment (see [§2.4.3](#2.4.3)). Otherwise, all variables are initialized with **nil**.

    A chunk is also a block (see [§2.4.1](#2.4.1)), and so local variables can be declared in a chunk outside any explicit block. The scope of such local variables extends until the end of the chunk.

    The visibility rules for local variables are explained in [§2.6](#2.6).
- name: Logical Operators
  summary: The logical operators in Lua are and, or, and not
  description: |-
    ### 2.5.3 – Logical Operators

    The logical operators in Lua are **and**, **or**, and **not**. Like the control structures (see [§2.4.4](#2.4.4)), all logical operators consider both **false** and **nil** as false and anything else as true.

    The negation operator **not** always returns **false** or **true**. The conjunction operator **and** returns its first argument if this value is **false** or **nil**; otherwise, **and** returns its second argument. The disjunction operator **or** returns its first argument if this value is different from **nil** and **false**; otherwise, **or** returns its second argument. Both **and** and **or** use short-cut evaluation; that is, the second operand is evaluated only if necessary. Here are some examples:

    ```
    10 or 20            --> 10
    10 or error()       --> 10
    nil or "a"          --> "a"
    nil and 10          --> nil
    false and error()   --> false
    false and nil       --> false
    false or nil        --> nil
    10 and 20           --> 20
    ```

- name: luaL_Buffer
  summary: Type for a string buffer
  description: |-
    ### `luaL_Buffer`

    ```
    typedef struct luaL_Buffer luaL_Buffer;
    ```

    Type for a *string buffer*.

    A string buffer allows C code to build Lua strings piecemeal. Its pattern of use is as follows:

    - First you declare a variable `b` of type [`luaL_Buffer`](#luaL_Buffer).
    - Then you initialize it with a call `luaL_buffinit(L, &b)`.
    - Then you add string pieces to the buffer calling any of the `luaL_add*` functions.
    - You finish by calling `luaL_pushresult(&b)`. This call leaves the final string on the top of the stack.

    During its normal operation, a string buffer uses a variable number of stack slots. So, while using a buffer, you cannot assume that you know where the top of the stack is. You can use the stack between successive calls to buffer operations as long as that use is balanced; that is, when you call a buffer operation, the stack is at the same level it was immediately after the previous buffer operation. (The only exception to this rule is [`luaL_addvalue`](#luaL_addvalue).) After calling [`luaL_pushresult`](#luaL_pushresult) the stack is back to its level when the buffer was initialized, plus the final string on its top.
- name: luaL_buffinit
  summary: Initializes a buffer B
  description: |-
    ### `luaL_buffinit`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    void luaL_buffinit (lua_State *L, luaL_Buffer *B);
    ```

    Initializes a buffer `B`. This function does not allocate any space; the buffer must be declared as a variable (see [`luaL_Buffer`](#luaL_Buffer)).
- name: luaL_callmeta
  summary: Calls a metamethod
  description: |-
    ### `luaL_callmeta`\[-0, +(0\|1), *e*\]

    ```
    int luaL_callmeta (lua_State *L, int obj, const char *e);
    ```

    Calls a metamethod.

    If the object at index `obj` has a metatable and this metatable has a field `e`, this function calls this field and passes the object as its only argument. In this case this function returns 1 and pushes onto the stack the value returned by the call. If there is no metatable or no metamethod, this function returns 0 (without pushing any value on the stack).

    Checks whether the function argument `narg` is a number and returns this number cast to a `long`.
- name: luaL_checklstring
  summary: Checks whether the function argument narg is a string and returns this string; if l is not NULL fills *l with the string's length

    ```
    const char *luaL_checklstring (lua_State *L, int narg, size_t *l);
    ```

    Checks whether the function argument `narg` is a string and returns this string; if `l` is not `NULL` fills `*l` with the string's length.

    This function uses [`lua_tolstring`](#lua_tolstring) to get its result, so all conversions and caveats of that function apply here.

- name: luaL_checkoption
  summary: Checks whether the function argument narg is a string and searches for this string in the array lst (which must be NULL-terminated)

    ```
    int luaL_checkoption (lua_State *L,
                          int narg,

                          const char *const lst[]);
    ```

    Checks whether the function argument `narg` is a string and searches for this string in the array `lst` (which must be NULL-terminated). Returns the index in the array where the string was found. Raises an error if the argument is not a string or if the string cannot be found.

    If `def` is not `NULL`, the function uses `def` as a default value when there is no argument `narg` or if this argument is **nil**.

    This is a useful function for mapping strings to C enums. (The usual convention in Lua libraries is to use strings instead of numbers to select options.)

    Creates and returns a *reference*, in the table at index `t`, for the object at the top of the stack (and pops the object).

    A reference is a unique integer key. As long as you do not manually add integer keys into table `t`, [`luaL_ref`](#luaL_ref) ensures the uniqueness of the key it returns. You can retrieve an object referred by reference `r` by calling `lua_rawgeti(L, t, r)`. Function [`luaL_unref`](#luaL_unref) frees a reference and its associated object.

    Opens a library.

    When called with `libname` equal to `NULL`, it simply registers all functions in the list `l` (see [`luaL_Reg`](#luaL_Reg)) into the table on the top of the stack.

    When called with a non-null `libname`, `luaL_register` creates a new table `t`, sets it as the value of the global variable `libname`, sets it as the value of `package.loaded[libname]`, and registers on it all functions in the list `l`. If there is a table in `package.loaded[libname]` or in variable `libname`, reuses this table instead of creating a new one.

    In any case the function leaves the table on the top of the stack.

- name: lua_Alloc
  summary: The type of the memory-allocation function used by Lua states
  description: |-
    ### `lua_Alloc`

    ```
    typedef void * (*lua_Alloc) (void *ud,
                                 void *ptr,
                                 size_t osize,
                                 size_t nsize);
    ```

    The type of the memory-allocation function used by Lua states. The allocator function must provide a functionality similar to `realloc`, but not exactly the same. Its arguments are `ud`, an opaque pointer passed to [`lua_newstate`](#lua_newstate); `ptr`, a pointer to the block being allocated/reallocated/freed; `osize`, the original size of the block; `nsize`, the new size of the block. `ptr` is `NULL` if and only if `osize` is zero. When `nsize` is zero, the allocator must return `NULL`; if `osize` is not zero, it should free the block pointed to by `ptr`. When `nsize` is not zero, the allocator returns `NULL` if and only if it cannot fill the request. When `nsize` is not zero and `osize` is zero, the allocator should behave like `malloc`. When `nsize` and `osize` are not zero, the allocator behaves like `realloc`. Lua assumes that the allocator never fails when `osize >= nsize`.

    Here is a simple implementation for the allocator function. It is used in the auxiliary library by [`luaL_newstate`](#luaL_newstate).

    ```
    static void *l_alloc (void *ud, void *ptr, size_t osize,
                                               size_t nsize) {
      (void)ud;  (void)osize;  /* not used */
      if (nsize == 0) {
        free(ptr);
        return NULL;
      }
      else
        return realloc(ptr, nsize);
    }
    ```

    This code assumes that `free(NULL)` has no effect and that `realloc(NULL, size)` is equivalent to `malloc(size)`. ANSI C ensures both behaviors.

    ### `lua_atpanic`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    lua_CFunction lua_atpanic (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction panicf);
    ```

    Sets a new panic function and returns the old one.

    If an error happens outside any protected environment, Lua calls a *panic function* and then calls `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`, thus exiting the host application. Your panic function can avoid this exit by never returning (e.g., doing a long jump).

    The panic function can access the error message at the top of the stack.

    ### `lua_call`\[-(nargs + 1), +nresults, *e*\]

    ```
    void lua_call (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults);
    ```

    Calls a function.

    To call a function you must use the following protocol: first, the function to be called is pushed onto the stack; then, the arguments to the function are pushed in direct order; that is, the first argument is pushed first. Finally you call [`lua_call`](#lua_call); `nargs` is the number of arguments that you pushed onto the stack. All arguments and the function value are popped from the stack when the function is called. The function results are pushed onto the stack when the function returns. The number of results is adjusted to `nresults`, unless `nresults` is
- name: lua_CFunction
  summary: Type for C functions
  description: |-
    ### `lua_CFunction`

    ```
    typedef int (*lua_CFunction) (lua_State *L);
    ```

    Type for C functions.

    In order to communicate properly with Lua, a C function must use the following protocol, which defines the way parameters and results are passed: a C function receives its arguments from Lua in its stack in direct order (the first argument is pushed first). So, when the function starts, `lua_gettop(L)` returns the number of arguments received by the function. The first argument (if any) is at index 1 and its last argument is at index `lua_gettop(L)`. To return values to Lua, a C function just pushes them onto the stack, in direct order (the first result is pushed first), and returns the number of results. Any other value in the stack below the results will be properly discarded by Lua. Like a Lua function, a C function called by Lua can also return many results.

    As an example, the following function receives a variable number of numerical arguments and returns their average and sum:

    ```
    static int foo (lua_State *L) {
      int n = lua_gettop(L);    /* number of arguments */
      lua_Number sum = 0;
      int i;
      for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!lua_isnumber(L, i)) {
          lua_pushstring(L, "incorrect argument");
          lua_error(L);
        }
        sum += lua_tonumber(L, i);
      }
      lua_pushnumber(L, sum/n);        /* first result */
      lua_pushnumber(L, sum);         /* second result */
      return 2;                   /* number of results */
    }

    int lua_checkstack (lua_State *L, int extra);
    ```

    Ensures that there are at least `extra` free stack slots in the stack. It returns false if it cannot grow the stack to that size. This function never shrinks the stack; if the stack is already larger than the new size, it is left unchanged.
- name: lua_close

  description: |-
    ### `lua_close`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_close (lua_State *L);
    ```

    Destroys all objects in the given Lua state (calling the corresponding garbage-collection metamethods, if any) and frees all dynamic memory used by this state. On several platforms, you may not need to call this function, because all resources are naturally released when the host program ends. On the other hand, long-running programs, such as a daemon or a web server, might need to release states as soon as they are not needed, to avoid growing too large.
- name: lua_concat
  summary: Concatenates the n values at the top of the stack, pops them, and leaves the result at the top
  description: |-
    ### `lua_concat`\[-n, +1, *e*\]

    ```
    void lua_concat (lua_State *L, int n);
    ```

    Concatenates the `n` values at the top of the stack, pops them, and leaves the result at the top. If `n` is 1, the result is the single value on the stack (that is, the function does nothing); if `n` is 0, the result is the empty string. Concatenation is performed following the usual semantics of Lua (see [§2.5.4](#2.5.4)).
- name: lua_cpcall
  summary: Calls the C function func in protected mode

    ### `lua_cpcall`\[-0, +(0\|1), *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_cpcall (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction func, void *ud);
    ```

    Calls the C function `func` in protected mode. `func` starts with only one element in its stack, a light userdata containing `ud`. In case of errors, [`lua_cpcall`](#lua_cpcall) returns the same error codes as [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall), plus the error object on the top of the stack; otherwise, it returns zero, and does not change the stack. All values returned by `func` are discarded.

    ```

    Creates a new empty table and pushes it onto the stack. The new table has space pre-allocated for `narr` array elements and `nrec` non-array elements. This pre-allocation is useful when you know exactly how many elements the table will have. Otherwise you can use the function [`lua_newtable`](#lua_newtable).

      char short_src[LUA_IDSIZE]; /* (S) */
      /* private part */
      other fields
    } lua_Debug;
    ```

    A structure used to carry different pieces of information about an active function. [`lua_getstack`](#lua_getstack) fills only the private part of this structure, for later use. To fill the other fields of [`lua_Debug`](#lua_Debug) with useful information, call [`lua_getinfo`](#lua_getinfo).

    The fields of [`lua_Debug`](#lua_Debug) have the following meaning:

    - `source`: If the function was defined in a string, then `source` is that string. If the function was defined in a file, then `source` starts with a '`@`' followed by the file name.
    - `short_src`: a "printable" version of `source`, to be used in error messages.
    - `linedefined`: the line number where the definition of the function starts.
    - `lastlinedefined`: the line number where the definition of the function ends.
    - `what`: the string `"Lua"` if the function is a Lua function, `"C"` if it is a C function, `"main"` if it is the main part of a chunk, and `"tail"` if it was a function that did a tail call. In the latter case, Lua has no other information about the function.
    - `currentline`: the current line where the given function is executing. When no line information is available, `currentline` is set to -1.
    - `name`: a reasonable name for the given function. Because functions in Lua are first-class values, they do not have a fixed name: some functions can be the value of multiple global variables, while others can be stored only in a table field. The `lua_getinfo` function checks how the function was called to find a suitable name. If it cannot find a name, then `name` is set to `NULL`.
    - `namewhat`: explains the `name` field. The value of `namewhat` can be `"global"`, `"local"`, `"method"`, `"field"`, `"upvalue"`, or `""` (the empty string), according to how the function was called. (Lua uses the empty string when no other option seems to apply.)
    - `nups`: the number of upvalues of the function.
- name: lua_dump

  description: |-
    ### `lua_dump`\[-0, +0, *m*\]

    ```
    int lua_dump (lua_State *L, lua_Writer writer, void *data);
    ```

    Dumps a function as a binary chunk. Receives a Lua function on the top of the stack and produces a binary chunk that, if loaded again, results in a function equivalent to the one dumped. As it produces parts of the chunk, [`lua_dump`](#lua_dump) calls function `writer` (see [`lua_Writer`](#lua_Writer)) with the given `data` to write them.

    The value returned is the error code returned by the last call to the writer; 0 means no errors.

    This function does not pop the Lua function from the stack.

  summary: Generates a Lua error
  description: |-
    ### `lua_error`\[-1, +0, *v*\]

    ```
    int lua_error (lua_State *L);

  description: |-
    ### `lua_gc`\[-0, +0, *e*\]

    ```
    int lua_gc (lua_State *L, int what, int data);
    ```

    Controls the garbage collector.

    This function performs several tasks, according to the value of the parameter `what`:

    - `LUA_GCSTOP`: stops the garbage collector.
    - `LUA_GCRESTART`: restarts the garbage collector.
    - `LUA_GCCOLLECT`: performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
    - `LUA_GCCOUNT`: returns the current amount of memory (in Kbytes) in use by Lua.
    - `LUA_GCCOUNTB`: returns the remainder of dividing the current amount of bytes of memory in use by Lua by 1024.
    - `LUA_GCSTEP`: performs an incremental step of garbage collection. The step "size" is controlled by `data` (larger values mean more steps) in a non-specified way. If you want to control the step size you must experimentally tune the value of `data`. The function returns 1 if the step finished a garbage-collection cycle.
    - `LUA_GCSETPAUSE`: sets `data` as the new value for the *pause* of the collector (see [§2.10](#2.10)). The function returns the previous value of the pause.
    - `LUA_GCSETSTEPMUL`: sets `data` as the new value for the *step multiplier* of the collector (see [§2.10](#2.10)). The function returns the previous value of the step multiplier.

    ```
    int lua_getinfo (lua_State *L, const char *what, lua_Debug *ar);
    ```

    Returns information about a specific function or function invocation.

    To get information about a function invocation, the parameter `ar` must be a valid activation record that was filled by a previous call to [`lua_getstack`](#lua_getstack) or given as argument to a hook (see [`lua_Hook`](#lua_Hook)).

    To get information about a function you push it onto the stack and start the `what` string with the character '`>`'. (In that case, `lua_getinfo` pops the function in the top of the stack.) For instance, to know in which line a function `f` was defined, you can write the following code:

    ```
    lua_Debug ar;
    lua_getfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "f");  /* get global 'f' */
    lua_getinfo(L, ">S", &ar);
    printf("%d\n", ar.linedefined);
    ```

    Each character in the string `what` selects some fields of the structure `ar` to be filled or a value to be pushed on the stack:

    - '`n`': fills in the field `name` and `namewhat`;
    - '`S`': fills in the fields `source`, `short_src`, `linedefined`, `lastlinedefined`, and `what`;
    - '`l`': fills in the field `currentline`;
    - '`u`': fills in the field `nups`;
    - '`f`': pushes onto the stack the function that is running at the given level;
    - '`L`': pushes onto the stack a table whose indices are the numbers of the lines that are valid on the function. (A *valid line* is a line with some associated code, that is, a line where you can put a break point. Non-valid lines include empty lines and comments.)

    This function returns 0 on error (for instance, an invalid option in `what`).
- name: lua_getlocal
  summary: Gets information about a local variable of a given activation record
  description: |-
    ### `lua_getlocal`\[-0, +(0\|1), *-*\]

    ```
    const char *lua_getlocal (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar, int n);
    ```

    Gets information about a local variable of a given activation record. The parameter `ar` must be a valid activation record that was filled by a previous call to [`lua_getstack`](#lua_getstack) or given as argument to a hook (see [`lua_Hook`](#lua_Hook)). The index `n` selects which local variable to inspect (1 is the first parameter or active local variable, and so on, until the last active local variable). [`lua_getlocal`](#lua_getlocal) pushes the variable's value onto the stack and returns its name.

    Variable names starting with '`(`' (open parentheses) represent internal variables (loop control variables, temporaries, and C function locals).

    Returns `NULL` (and pushes nothing) when the index is greater than the number of active local variables.
- name: lua_getmetatable
  summary: Pushes onto the stack the metatable of the value at the given acceptable index
  description: |-
    ### `lua_getmetatable`\[-0, +(0\|1), *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_getmetatable (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Pushes onto the stack the metatable of the value at the given acceptable index. If the index is not valid, or if the value does not have a metatable, the function returns 0 and pushes nothing on the stack.
- name: lua_getstack
  summary: Get information about the interpreter runtime stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_getstack`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_getstack (lua_State *L, int level, lua_Debug *ar);
    ```

    Get information about the interpreter runtime stack.

    This function fills parts of a [`lua_Debug`](#lua_Debug) structure with an identification of the *activation record* of the function executing at a given level. Level 0 is the current running function, whereas level *n+1* is the function that has called level *n*. When there are no errors, [`lua_getstack`](#lua_getstack) returns 1; when called with a level greater than the stack depth, it returns 0.
- name: lua_gettable
  summary: Pushes onto the stack the value t[k], where t is the value at the given valid index and k is the value at the top of the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_gettable`\[-1, +1, *e*\]

    ```
    void lua_gettable (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Pushes onto the stack the value `t[k]`, where `t` is the value at the given valid index and `k` is the value at the top of the stack.

    This function pops the key from the stack (putting the resulting value in its place). As in Lua, this function may trigger a metamethod for the "index" event (see [§2.8](#2.8)).
- name: lua_gettop
  summary: Returns the index of the top element in the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_gettop`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_gettop (lua_State *L);
    ```

    Returns the index of the top element in the stack. Because indices start at 1, this result is equal to the number of elements in the stack (and so 0 means an empty stack).
- name: lua_getupvalue
  summary: Gets information about a closure's upvalue
  description: |-
    ### `lua_getupvalue`\[-0, +(0\|1), *-*\]

    ```
    const char *lua_getupvalue (lua_State *L, int funcindex, int n);
    ```

    Gets information about a closure's upvalue. (For Lua functions, upvalues are the external local variables that the function uses, and that are consequently included in its closure.) [`lua_getupvalue`](#lua_getupvalue) gets the index `n` of an upvalue, pushes the upvalue's value onto the stack, and returns its name. `funcindex` points to the closure in the stack. (Upvalues have no particular order, as they are active through the whole function. So, they are numbered in an arbitrary order.)

    Returns `NULL` (and pushes nothing) when the index is greater than the number of upvalues. For C functions, this function uses the empty string `""` as a name for all upvalues.
- name: lua_Hook
  summary: Type for debugging hook functions
  description: |-
    ### `lua_Hook`

    ```
    typedef void (*lua_Hook) (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar);
    ```

    Type for debugging hook functions.

    Whenever a hook is called, its `ar` argument has its field `event` set to the specific event that triggered the hook. Lua identifies these events with the following constants:
- name: lua_insert
  summary: Moves the top element into the given valid index, shifting up the elements above this index to open space
  description: |-
    ### `lua_insert`\[-1, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_insert (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Moves the top element into the given valid index, shifting up the elements above this index to open space. Cannot be called with a pseudo-index, because a pseudo-index is not an actual stack position.
- name: lua_Integer
  summary: The type used by the Lua API to represent integral values
  description: |-
    ### `lua_Integer`

    ```
    typedef ptrdiff_t lua_Integer;
    ```

    The type used by the Lua API to represent integral values.

    By default it is a `ptrdiff_t`, which is usually the largest signed integral type the machine handles "comfortably".
- name: lua_isboolean
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index has type boolean, and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isboolean`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_isboolean (lua_State *L, int index);

    ### `lua_isfunction`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_isfunction (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a function (either C or Lua), and 0 otherwise.

  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a light userdata, and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_islightuserdata`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_islightuserdata (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a light userdata, and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_isnil
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is nil, and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isnil`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    int lua_isnil (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is **nil**, and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_isnone
  summary: Returns 1 if the given acceptable index is not valid (that is, it refers to an element outside the current stack), and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isnone`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_isnone (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the given acceptable index is not valid (that is, it refers to an element outside the current stack), and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_isnoneornil
  summary: Returns 1 if the given acceptable index is not valid (that is, it refers to an element outside the current stack) or if the value at this index is nil, and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isnoneornil`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_isnoneornil (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the given acceptable index is not valid (that is, it refers to an element outside the current stack) or if the value at this index is **nil**, and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_isnumber
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a number or a string convertible to a number, and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isnumber`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_isnumber (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a number or a string convertible to a number, and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_isstring
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a string or a number (which is always convertible to a string), and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isstring`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_isstring (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a string or a number (which is always convertible to a string), and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_istable
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a table, and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_istable`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_istable (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a table, and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_isthread
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a thread, and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isthread`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a thread, and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_isuserdata
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a userdata (either full or light), and 0 otherwise
  description: |-
    ### `lua_isuserdata`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_isuserdata (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at the given acceptable index is a userdata (either full or light), and 0 otherwise.
- name: lua_lessthan
  summary: Returns 1 if the value at acceptable index index1 is smaller than the value at acceptable index index2, following the semantics of the Lua < operator (that is, may call metamethods)
  description: |-
    ### `lua_lessthan`\[-0, +0, *e*\]

    ```
    int lua_lessthan (lua_State *L, int index1, int index2);
    ```

    Returns 1 if the value at acceptable index `index1` is smaller than the value at acceptable index `index2`, following the semantics of the Lua `<` operator (that is, may call metamethods). Otherwise returns 0. Also returns 0 if any of the indices is non valid.
- name: lua_load
  summary: Loads a Lua chunk
  description: |-
    ### `lua_load`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_load (lua_State *L,
                  lua_Reader reader,
                  void *data,
                  const char *chunkname);
    ```

    Loads a Lua chunk. If there are no errors, [`lua_load`](#lua_load) pushes the compiled chunk as a Lua function on top of the stack. Otherwise, it pushes an error message. The return values of [`lua_load`](#lua_load) are:

    **0:** no errors;
- name: lua_newstate
  summary: Creates a new, independent state
  description: |-
    ### `lua_newstate`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    lua_State *lua_newstate (lua_Alloc f, void *ud);
    ```

    Creates a new, independent state. Returns `NULL` if cannot create the state (due to lack of memory). The argument `f` is the allocator function; Lua does all memory allocation for this state through this function. The second argument, `ud`, is an opaque pointer that Lua simply passes to the allocator in every call.
- name: lua_newtable
  summary: Creates a new empty table and pushes it onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_newtable`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    void lua_newtable (lua_State *L);
    ```

    Creates a new empty table and pushes it onto the stack. It is equivalent to `lua_createtable(L, 0, 0)`.
- name: lua_newthread
  summary: Creates a new thread, pushes it on the stack, and returns a pointer to a lua_State that represents this new thread
  description: |-
    ### `lua_newthread`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    lua_State *lua_newthread (lua_State *L);
    ```

    Creates a new thread, pushes it on the stack, and returns a pointer to a [`lua_State`](#lua_State) that represents this new thread. The new state returned by this function shares with the original state all global objects (such as tables), but has an independent execution stack.

    There is no explicit function to close or to destroy a thread. Threads are subject to garbage collection, like any Lua object.
- name: lua_newuserdata
  summary: This function allocates a new block of memory with the given size, pushes onto the stack a new full userdata with the block address, and returns this address
  description: |-
    ### `lua_newuserdata`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    void *lua_newuserdata (lua_State *L, size_t size);
    ```

    This function allocates a new block of memory with the given size, pushes onto the stack a new full userdata with the block address, and returns this address.

    Userdata represent C values in Lua. A *full userdata* represents a block of memory. It is an object (like a table): you must create it, it can have its own metatable, and you can detect when it is being collected. A full userdata is only equal to itself (under raw equality).

    When Lua collects a full userdata with a `gc` metamethod, Lua calls the metamethod and marks the userdata as finalized. When this userdata is collected again then Lua frees its corresponding memory.
- name: lua_next
  summary: Pops a key from the stack, and pushes a key-value pair from the table at the given index (the "next" pair after the given key)
  description: |-
    ### `lua_next`\[-1, +(2\|0), *e*\]

    ```
    int lua_next (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Pops a key from the stack, and pushes a key-value pair from the table at the given index (the "next" pair after the given key). If there are no more elements in the table, then [`lua_next`](#lua_next) returns 0 (and pushes nothing).

    A typical traversal looks like this:

    ```
    /* table is in the stack at index 't' */
    lua_pushnil(L);  /* first key */
    while (lua_next(L, t) != 0) {
      /* uses 'key' (at index -2) and 'value' (at index -1) */
      printf("%s - %s\n",
             lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -2)),
             lua_typename(L, lua_type(L, -1)));
      /* removes 'value'; keeps 'key' for next iteration */
      lua_pop(L, 1);
    }
    ```

    While traversing a table, do not call [`lua_tolstring`](#lua_tolstring) directly on a key, unless you know that the key is actually a string. Recall that [`lua_tolstring`](#lua_tolstring) *changes* the value at the given index; this confuses the next call to [`lua_next`](#lua_next).
- name: lua_Number
  summary: The type of numbers in Lua
  description: |-
    ### `lua_Number`

    ```
    typedef double lua_Number;
    ```

    The type of numbers in Lua. By default, it is double, but that can be changed in `luaconf.h`.

    Through the configuration file you can change Lua to operate with another type for numbers (e.g., float or long).
- name: lua_objlen
  summary: 'Returns the "length" of the value at the given acceptable index: for strings, this is the string length; for tables, this is the result of the length operator (''#''); for userdata, this is the size of the block of memory allocated for the userdata; for other values, it is 0'
  description: |-
    ### `lua_objlen`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    size_t lua_objlen (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns the "length" of the value at the given acceptable index: for strings, this is the string length; for tables, this is the result of the length operator ('`#`'); for userdata, this is the size of the block of memory allocated for the userdata; for other values, it is 0.
- name: lua_pcall
  summary: Calls a function in protected mode
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pcall`\[-(nargs + 1), +(nresults\|1), *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_pcall (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults, int errfunc);
    ```

    Calls a function in protected mode.

    Both `nargs` and `nresults` have the same meaning as in [`lua_call`](#lua_call). If there are no errors during the call, [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall) behaves exactly like [`lua_call`](#lua_call). However, if there is any error, [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall) catches it, pushes a single value on the stack (the error message), and returns an error code. Like [`lua_call`](#lua_call), [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall) always removes the function and its arguments from the stack.

    If `errfunc` is 0, then the error message returned on the stack is exactly the original error message. Otherwise, `errfunc` is the stack index of an *error handler function*. (In the current implementation, this index cannot be a pseudo-index.) In case of runtime errors, this function will be called with the error message and its return value will be the message returned on the stack by [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall).

    Typically, the error handler function is used to add more debug information to the error message, such as a stack traceback. Such information cannot be gathered after the return of [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall), since by then the stack has unwound.

    The [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall) function returns 0 in case of success or one of the following error codes (defined in `lua.h`):
- name: lua_pop
  summary: Pops n elements from the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pop`\[-n, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_pop (lua_State *L, int n);
    ```

    Pops `n` elements from the stack.
- name: lua_pushboolean
  summary: Pushes a boolean value with value b onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushboolean`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushboolean (lua_State *L, int b);
    ```

    Pushes a boolean value with value `b` onto the stack.
- name: lua_pushcclosure
  summary: Pushes a new C closure onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushcclosure`\[-n, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushcclosure (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction fn, int n);
    ```

    Pushes a new C closure onto the stack.

    When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it, thus creating a C closure (see [§3.4](#3.4)); these values are then accessible to the function whenever it is called. To associate values with a C function, first these values should be pushed onto the stack (when there are multiple values, the first value is pushed first). Then [`lua_pushcclosure`](#lua_pushcclosure) is called to create and push the C function onto the stack, with the argument `n` telling how many values should be associated with the function. [`lua_pushcclosure`](#lua_pushcclosure) also pops these values from the stack.

    The maximum value for `n` is 255.
- name: lua_pushcfunction
  summary: Pushes a C function onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushcfunction`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushcfunction (lua_State *L, lua_CFunction f);
    ```

    Pushes a C function onto the stack. This function receives a pointer to a C function and pushes onto the stack a Lua value of type `function` that, when called, invokes the corresponding C function.

    Any function to be registered in Lua must follow the correct protocol to receive its parameters and return its results (see [`lua_CFunction`](#lua_CFunction)).

    `lua_pushcfunction` is defined as a macro:

    ```
    #define lua_pushcfunction(L,f)  lua_pushcclosure(L,f,0)
    ```
- name: lua_pushfstring
  summary: Pushes onto the stack a formatted string and returns a pointer to this string
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushfstring`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    const char *lua_pushfstring (lua_State *L, const char *fmt, ...);
    ```

    Pushes onto the stack a formatted string and returns a pointer to this string. It is similar to the C function `sprintf`, but has some important differences:

    - You do not have to allocate space for the result: the result is a Lua string and Lua takes care of memory allocation (and deallocation, through garbage collection).
    - The conversion specifiers are quite restricted. There are no flags, widths, or precisions. The conversion specifiers can only be '`%%`' (inserts a '`%`' in the string), '`%s`' (inserts a zero-terminated string, with no size restrictions), '`%f`' (inserts a [`lua_Number`](#lua_Number)), '`%p`' (inserts a pointer as a hexadecimal numeral), '`%d`' (inserts an `int`), and '`%c`' (inserts an `int` as a character).
- name: lua_pushinteger
  summary: Pushes a number with value n onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushinteger`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushinteger (lua_State *L, lua_Integer n);
    ```

    Pushes a number with value `n` onto the stack.
- name: lua_pushlightuserdata
  summary: Pushes a light userdata onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushlightuserdata`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushlightuserdata (lua_State *L, void *p);
    ```

    Pushes a light userdata onto the stack.

    Userdata represent C values in Lua. A *light userdata* represents a pointer. It is a value (like a number): you do not create it, it has no individual metatable, and it is not collected (as it was never created). A light userdata is equal to "any" light userdata with the same C address.
- name: lua_pushliteral
  summary: This macro is equivalent to lua_pushlstring, but can be used only when s is a literal string
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushliteral`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushliteral (lua_State *L, const char *s);
    ```

    This macro is equivalent to [`lua_pushlstring`](#lua_pushlstring), but can be used only when `s` is a literal string. In these cases, it automatically provides the string length.
- name: lua_pushlstring
  summary: Pushes the string pointed to by s with size len onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushlstring`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushlstring (lua_State *L, const char *s, size_t len);
    ```

    Pushes the string pointed to by `s` with size `len` onto the stack. Lua makes (or reuses) an internal copy of the given string, so the memory at `s` can be freed or reused immediately after the function returns. The string can contain embedded zeros.
- name: lua_pushnil
  summary: Pushes a nil value onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushnil`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushnil (lua_State *L);
    ```

    Pushes a nil value onto the stack.
- name: lua_pushnumber
  summary: Pushes a number with value n onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushnumber`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushnumber (lua_State *L, lua_Number n);
    ```

    Pushes a number with value `n` onto the stack.
- name: lua_pushstring
  summary: Pushes the zero-terminated string pointed to by s onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushstring`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushstring (lua_State *L, const char *s);
    ```

    Pushes the zero-terminated string pointed to by `s` onto the stack. Lua makes (or reuses) an internal copy of the given string, so the memory at `s` can be freed or reused immediately after the function returns. The string cannot contain embedded zeros; it is assumed to end at the first zero.
- name: lua_pushthread
  summary: Pushes the thread represented by L onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushthread`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_pushthread (lua_State *L);
    ```

    Pushes the thread represented by `L` onto the stack. Returns 1 if this thread is the main thread of its state.
- name: lua_pushvalue
  summary: Pushes a copy of the element at the given valid index onto the stack
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushvalue`\[-0, +1, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_pushvalue (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Pushes a copy of the element at the given valid index onto the stack.
- name: lua_pushvfstring
  summary: Equivalent to lua_pushfstring, except that it receives a va_list instead of a variable number of arguments
  description: |-
    ### `lua_pushvfstring`\[-0, +1, *m*\]

    ```
    const char *lua_pushvfstring (lua_State *L,
                                  const char *fmt,
                                  va_list argp);
    ```

    Equivalent to [`lua_pushfstring`](#lua_pushfstring), except that it receives a `va_list` instead of a variable number of arguments.

- name: lua_Reader
  summary: The reader function used by lua_load
  description: |-
    ### `lua_Reader`

    ```
    typedef const char * (*lua_Reader) (lua_State *L,

                                        size_t *size);
    ```

    The reader function used by [`lua_load`](#lua_load). Every time it needs another piece of the chunk, [`lua_load`](#lua_load) calls the reader, passing along its `data` parameter. The reader must return a pointer to a block of memory with a new piece of the chunk and set `size` to the block size. The block must exist until the reader function is called again. To signal the end of the chunk, the reader must return `NULL` or set `size` to zero. The reader function may return pieces of any size greater than zero.
- name: lua_register
  summary: Sets the C function f as the new value of global name
  description: |-
    ### `lua_register`\[-0, +0, *e*\]

                       const char *name,
                       lua_CFunction f);
    ```

    Sets the C function `f` as the new value of global `name`. It is defined as a macro:

  summary: Removes the element at the given valid index, shifting down the elements above this index to fill the gap
  description: |-
    ### `lua_remove`\[-1, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_remove (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Removes the element at the given valid index, shifting down the elements above this index to fill the gap. Cannot be called with a pseudo-index, because a pseudo-index is not an actual stack position.
- name: lua_replace
  summary: Moves the top element into the given position (and pops it), without shifting any element (therefore replacing the value at the given position)
  description: |-
    ### `lua_replace`\[-1, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_replace (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Moves the top element into the given position (and pops it), without shifting any element (therefore replacing the value at the given position).
- name: lua_resume
  summary: Starts and resumes a coroutine in a given thread
  description: |-
    ### `lua_resume`\[-?, +?, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_resume (lua_State *L, int narg);
    ```

    Starts and resumes a coroutine in a given thread.

    To start a coroutine, you first create a new thread (see [`lua_newthread`](#lua_newthread)); then you push onto its stack the main function plus any arguments; then you call [`lua_resume`](#lua_resume), with `narg` being the number of arguments. This call returns when the coroutine suspends or finishes its execution. When it returns, the stack contains all values passed to [`lua_yield`](#lua_yield), or all values returned by the body function. [`lua_resume`](#lua_resume) returns [`LUA_YIELD`](#pdf-LUA_YIELD) if the coroutine yields, 0 if the coroutine finishes its execution without errors, or an error code in case of errors (see [`lua_pcall`](#lua_pcall)). In case of errors, the stack is not unwound, so you can use the debug API over it. The error message is on the top of the stack. To restart a coroutine, you put on its stack only the values to be passed as results from `yield`, and then call [`lua_resume`](#lua_resume).

    ```
    int lua_setfenv (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Pops a table from the stack and sets it as the new environment for the value at the given index. If the value at the given index is neither a function nor a thread nor a userdata, [`lua_setfenv`](#lua_setfenv) returns 0. Otherwise it returns 1.

    int lua_sethook (lua_State *L, lua_Hook f, int mask, int count);
    ```

    Sets the debugging hook function.

    Argument `f` is the hook function. `mask` specifies on which events the hook will be called: it is formed by a bitwise or of the constants
- name: lua_setlocal
  summary: Sets the value of a local variable of a given activation record
  description: |-
    ### `lua_setlocal`\[-(0\|1), +0, *-*\]

    ```
    const char *lua_setlocal (lua_State *L, lua_Debug *ar, int n);
    ```

    Sets the value of a local variable of a given activation record. Parameters `ar` and `n` are as in [`lua_getlocal`](#lua_getlocal) (see [`lua_getlocal`](#lua_getlocal)). [`lua_setlocal`](#lua_setlocal) assigns the value at the top of the stack to the variable and returns its name. It also pops the value from the stack.

    Returns `NULL` (and pops nothing) when the index is greater than the number of active local variables.

- name: lua_settable
  summary: Does the equivalent to t[k] = v, where t is the value at the given valid index, v is the value at the top of the stack, and k is the value just below the top
  description: |-
    ### `lua_settable`\[-2, +0, *e*\]

    ```
    void lua_settable (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Does the equivalent to `t[k] = v`, where `t` is the value at the given valid index, `v` is the value at the top of the stack, and `k` is the value just below the top.

    This function pops both the key and the value from the stack. As in Lua, this function may trigger a metamethod for the "newindex" event (see [§2.8](#2.8)).

    ```

    Sets the value of a closure's upvalue. It assigns the value at the top of the stack to the upvalue and returns its name. It also pops the value from the stack. Parameters `funcindex` and `n` are as in the [`lua_getupvalue`](#lua_getupvalue) (see [`lua_getupvalue`](#lua_getupvalue)).

    Returns `NULL` (and pops nothing) when the index is greater than the number of upvalues.
- name: lua_State
  summary: Opaque structure that keeps the whole state of a Lua interpreter
  description: |-
    ### `lua_State`

    ```
    typedef struct lua_State lua_State;
    ```

    Opaque structure that keeps the whole state of a Lua interpreter. The Lua library is fully reentrant: it has no global variables. All information about a state is kept in this structure.

    A pointer to this state must be passed as the first argument to every function in the library, except to [`lua_newstate`](#lua_newstate), which creates a Lua state from scratch.
- name: lua_status
  summary: Returns the status of the thread L

- name: lua_toboolean
  summary: Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to a C boolean value (0 or 1)
  description: |-
    ### `lua_toboolean`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_toboolean (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to a C boolean value (0 or 1). Like all tests in Lua, [`lua_toboolean`](#lua_toboolean) returns 1 for any Lua value different from **false** and **nil**; otherwise it returns 0. It also returns 0 when called with a non-valid index. (If you want to accept only actual boolean values, use [`lua_isboolean`](#lua_isboolean) to test the value's type.)
- name: lua_tocfunction
  summary: Converts a value at the given acceptable index to a C function
  description: |-
    ### `lua_tocfunction`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    lua_CFunction lua_tocfunction (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Converts a value at the given acceptable index to a C function. That value must be a C function; otherwise, returns `NULL`.
- name: lua_tointeger
  summary: Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to the signed integral type lua_Integer
  description: |-
    ### `lua_tointeger`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    lua_Integer lua_tointeger (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to the signed integral type [`lua_Integer`](#lua_Integer). The Lua value must be a number or a string convertible to a number (see [§2.2.1](#2.2.1)); otherwise, [`lua_tointeger`](#lua_tointeger) returns 0.

    If the number is not an integer, it is truncated in some non-specified way.
- name: lua_tolstring
  summary: Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to a C string
  description: |-
    ### `lua_tolstring`\[-0, +0, *m*\]

    ```
    const char *lua_tolstring (lua_State *L, int index, size_t *len);
    ```

    Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to a C string. If `len` is not `NULL`, it also sets `*len` with the string length. The Lua value must be a string or a number; otherwise, the function returns `NULL`. If the value is a number, then [`lua_tolstring`](#lua_tolstring) also *changes the actual value in the stack to a string*. (This change confuses [`lua_next`](#lua_next) when [`lua_tolstring`](#lua_tolstring) is applied to keys during a table traversal.)

    [`lua_tolstring`](#lua_tolstring) returns a fully aligned pointer to a string inside the Lua state. This string always has a zero ('`\0`') after its last character (as in C), but can contain other zeros in its body. Because Lua has garbage collection, there is no guarantee that the pointer returned by [`lua_tolstring`](#lua_tolstring) will be valid after the corresponding value is removed from the stack.
- name: lua_tonumber
  summary: Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to the C type lua_Number (see lua_Number)
  description: |-

    lua_Number lua_tonumber (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Converts the Lua value at the given acceptable index to the C type [`lua_Number`](#lua_Number) (see [`lua_Number`](#lua_Number)). The Lua value must be a number or a string convertible to a number (see [§2.2.1](#2.2.1)); otherwise, [`lua_tonumber`](#lua_tonumber) returns 0.
- name: lua_topointer
  summary: Converts the value at the given acceptable index to a generic C pointer (void*)
  description: |-
    ### `lua_topointer`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    const void *lua_topointer (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Converts the value at the given acceptable index to a generic C pointer (`void*`). The value can be a userdata, a table, a thread, or a function; otherwise, [`lua_topointer`](#lua_topointer) returns `NULL`. Different objects will give different pointers. There is no way to convert the pointer back to its original value.

    Typically this function is used only for debug information.
- name: lua_tostring

  summary: Converts the value at the given acceptable index to a Lua thread (represented as lua_State*)
  description: |-
    ### `lua_tothread`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    lua_State *lua_tothread (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Converts the value at the given acceptable index to a Lua thread (represented as `lua_State*`). This value must be a thread; otherwise, the function returns `NULL`.
- name: lua_touserdata
  summary: If the value at the given acceptable index is a full userdata, returns its block address
  description: |-
    ### `lua_touserdata`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    void *lua_touserdata (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    If the value at the given acceptable index is a full userdata, returns its block address. If the value is a light userdata, returns its pointer. Otherwise, returns `NULL`.
- name: lua_type
  summary: Returns the type of the value in the given acceptable index, or LUA_TNONE for a non-valid index (that is, an index to an "empty" stack position)
  description: |-
    ### `lua_type`\[-0, +0, *-*\]

    ```
    int lua_type (lua_State *L, int index);
    ```

    Returns the type of the value in the given acceptable index, or `LUA_TNONE` for a non-valid index (that is, an index to an "empty" stack position). The types returned by [`lua_type`](#lua_type) are coded by the following constants defined in `lua.h`: `LUA_TNIL`, `LUA_TNUMBER`, `LUA_TBOOLEAN`, `LUA_TSTRING`, `LUA_TTABLE`, `LUA_TFUNCTION`, `LUA_TUSERDATA`, `LUA_TTHREAD`, and `LUA_TLIGHTUSERDATA`.

- name: lua_Writer
  summary: The type of the writer function used by lua_dump
  description: |-

                               void* ud);
    ```

    The type of the writer function used by [`lua_dump`](#lua_dump). Every time it produces another piece of chunk, [`lua_dump`](#lua_dump) calls the writer, passing along the buffer to be written (`p`), its size (`sz`), and the `data` parameter supplied to [`lua_dump`](#lua_dump).

    The writer returns an error code: 0 means no errors; any other value means an error and stops [`lua_dump`](#lua_dump) from calling the writer again.
- name: lua_xmove
  summary: Exchange values between different threads of the same global state
  description: |-
    ### `lua_xmove`\[-?, +?, *-*\]

    ```
    void lua_xmove (lua_State *from, lua_State *to, int n);

    Yields a coroutine.

    This function should only be called as the return expression of a C function, as follows:

    ```
    return lua_yield (L, nresults);
    ```

    When a C function calls [`lua_yield`](#lua_yield) in that way, the running coroutine suspends its execution, and the call to [`lua_resume`](#lua_resume) that started this coroutine returns. The parameter `nresults` is the number of values from the stack that are passed as results to [`lua_resume`](#lua_resume).

    When called without arguments, returns a uniform pseudo-random real number in the range *\[0,1)*. When called with an integer number `m`, `math.random` returns a uniform pseudo-random integer in the range *\[1, m\]*. When called with two integer numbers `m` and `n`, `math.random` returns a uniform pseudo-random integer in the range *\[m, n\]*.

  summary: Every value in Lua can have a metatable
  description: |-
    ## 2.8 – Metatables

    Every value in Lua can have a *metatable*. This *metatable* is an ordinary Lua table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special operations. You can change several aspects of the behavior of operations over a value by setting specific fields in its metatable. For instance, when a non-numeric value is the operand of an addition, Lua checks for a function in the field `"__add"` in its metatable. If it finds one, Lua calls this function to perform the addition.

    We call the keys in a metatable *events* and the values *metamethods*. In the previous example, the event is `"add"` and the metamethod is the function that performs the addition.

    You can query the metatable of any value through the [`getmetatable`](#pdf-getmetatable) function.

    You can replace the metatable of tables through the [`setmetatable`](#pdf-setmetatable) function. You cannot change the metatable of other types from Lua (except by using the debug library); you must use the C API for that.

    Tables and full userdata have individual metatables (although multiple tables and userdata can share their metatables). Values of all other types share one single metatable per type; that is, there is one single metatable for all numbers, one for all strings, etc.

    A metatable controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, order comparisons, concatenation, length operation, and indexing. A metatable also can define a function to be called when a userdata is garbage collected. For each of these operations Lua associates a specific key called an *event*. When Lua performs one of these operations over a value, it checks whether this value has a metatable with the corresponding event. If so, the value associated with that key (the metamethod) controls how Lua will perform the operation.

    Metatables control the operations listed next. Each operation is identified by its corresponding name. The key for each operation is a string with its name prefixed by two underscores, '`__`'; for instance, the key for operation "add" is the string `"__add"`. The semantics of these operations is better explained by a Lua function describing how the interpreter executes the operation.

    The code shown here in Lua is only illustrative; the real behavior is hard coded in the interpreter and it is much more efficient than this simulation. All functions used in these descriptions ([`rawget`](#pdf-rawget), [`tonumber`](#pdf-tonumber), etc.) are described in [§5.1](#5.1). In particular, to retrieve the metamethod of a given object, we use the expression

    ```
    metatable(obj)[event]
    ```

    This should be read as

    ```
    rawget(getmetatable(obj) or {}, event)
    ```

    That is, the access to a metamethod does not invoke other metamethods, and the access to objects with no metatables does not fail (it simply results in **nil**).

    - **"add":** the `+` operation.

      The function `getbinhandler` below defines how Lua chooses a handler for a binary operation. First, Lua tries the first operand. If its type does not define a handler for the operation, then Lua tries the second operand.

      ```
      function getbinhandler (op1, op2, event)
        return metatable(op1)[event] or metatable(op2)[event]
      end
      ```

      By using this function, the behavior of the `op1 + op2` is

      ```
      function add_event (op1, op2)
        local o1, o2 = tonumber(op1), tonumber(op2)
        if o1 and o2 then  -- both operands are numeric?
          return o1 + o2   -- '+' here is the primitive 'add'
        else  -- at least one of the operands is not numeric
          local h = getbinhandler(op1, op2, "__add")
          if h then
            -- call the handler with both operands
            return (h(op1, op2))
          else  -- no handler available: default behavior
            error(···)
          end
        end
      end
      ```

    - **"sub":** the `-` operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

    - **"mul":** the `*` operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

    - **"div":** the `/` operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation.

    - **"mod":** the `%` operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, with the operation `o1 - floor(o1/o2)*o2` as the primitive operation.

    - **"pow":** the `^` (exponentiation) operation. Behavior similar to the "add" operation, with the function `pow` (from the C math library) as the primitive operation.

    - **"unm":** the unary `-` operation.

      ```
      function unm_event (op)
        local o = tonumber(op)
        if o then  -- operand is numeric?
          return -o  -- '-' here is the primitive 'unm'
        else  -- the operand is not numeric.
          -- Try to get a handler from the operand
          local h = metatable(op).__unm
          if h then
            -- call the handler with the operand
            return (h(op))
          else  -- no handler available: default behavior
            error(···)
          end
        end
      end
      ```

    - **"concat":** the `..` (concatenation) operation.

      ```
      function concat_event (op1, op2)
        if (type(op1) == "string" or type(op1) == "number") and
           (type(op2) == "string" or type(op2) == "number") then
          return op1 .. op2  -- primitive string concatenation
        else
          local h = getbinhandler(op1, op2, "__concat")
          if h then
            return (h(op1, op2))
          else
            error(···)
          end
        end
      end
      ```

    - **"len":** the `#` operation.

      ```
      function len_event (op)
        if type(op) == "string" then
          return strlen(op)         -- primitive string length
        elseif type(op) == "table" then
          return #op                -- primitive table length
        else
          local h = metatable(op).__len
          if h then
            -- call the handler with the operand
            return (h(op))
          else  -- no handler available: default behavior
            error(···)
          end
        end
      end
      ```

      See [§2.5.5](#2.5.5) for a description of the length of a table.

    - **"eq":** the `==` operation. The function `getcomphandler` defines how Lua chooses a metamethod for comparison operators. A metamethod only is selected when both objects being compared have the same type and the same metamethod for the selected operation.

      ```
      function getcomphandler (op1, op2, event)
        if type(op1) ~= type(op2) then return nil end
        local mm1 = metatable(op1)[event]
        local mm2 = metatable(op2)[event]
        if mm1 == mm2 then return mm1 else return nil end
      end
      ```

      The "eq" event is defined as follows:

      ```
      function eq_event (op1, op2)
        if type(op1) ~= type(op2) then  -- different types?
          return false   -- different objects
        end
        if op1 == op2 then   -- primitive equal?
          return true   -- objects are equal
        end
        -- try metamethod
        local h = getcomphandler(op1, op2, "__eq")
        if h then
          return (h(op1, op2))
        else
          return false
        end
      end
      ```

      `a ~= b` is equivalent to `not (a == b)`.

    - **"lt":** the `<` operation.

      ```
      function lt_event (op1, op2)
        if type(op1) == "number" and type(op2) == "number" then
          return op1 < op2   -- numeric comparison
        elseif type(op1) == "string" and type(op2) == "string" then
          return op1 < op2   -- lexicographic comparison
        else
          local h = getcomphandler(op1, op2, "__lt")
          if h then
            return (h(op1, op2))
          else
            error(···)
          end
        end
      end
      ```

      `a > b` is equivalent to `b < a`.

    - **"le":** the `<=` operation.

      ```
      function le_event (op1, op2)
        if type(op1) == "number" and type(op2) == "number" then
          return op1 <= op2   -- numeric comparison
        elseif type(op1) == "string" and type(op2) == "string" then
          return op1 <= op2   -- lexicographic comparison
        else
          local h = getcomphandler(op1, op2, "__le")
          if h then
            return (h(op1, op2))
          else
            h = getcomphandler(op1, op2, "__lt")
            if h then
              return not h(op2, op1)
            else
              error(···)
            end
          end
        end
      end
      ```

      `a >= b` is equivalent to `b <= a`. Note that, in the absence of a "le" metamethod, Lua tries the "lt", assuming that `a <= b` is equivalent to `not (b < a)`.

    - **"index":** The indexing access `table[key]`.

      ```
      function gettable_event (table, key)
        local h
        if type(table) == "table" then
          local v = rawget(table, key)
          if v ~= nil then return v end
          h = metatable(table).__index
          if h == nil then return nil end
        else
          h = metatable(table).__index
          if h == nil then
            error(···)
          end
        end
        if type(h) == "function" then
          return (h(table, key))     -- call the handler
        else return h[key]           -- or repeat operation on it
        end
      end
      ```

    - **"newindex":** The indexing assignment `table[key] = value`.

      ```
      function settable_event (table, key, value)
        local h
        if type(table) == "table" then
          local v = rawget(table, key)
          if v ~= nil then rawset(table, key, value); return end
          h = metatable(table).__newindex
          if h == nil then rawset(table, key, value); return end
        else
          h = metatable(table).__newindex
          if h == nil then
            error(···)
          end
        end
        if type(h) == "function" then
          h(table, key,value)           -- call the handler
        else h[key] = value             -- or repeat operation on it
        end
      end
      ```

    - **"call":** called when Lua calls a value.

      ```
      function function_event (func, ...)
        if type(func) == "function" then
          return func(...)   -- primitive call
        else
          local h = metatable(func).__call
          if h then
            return h(func, ...)
          else
            error(···)
          end
        end
      end
      ```
- name: module()
  summary: Creates a module
  description: |-
    ### `module (name [, ···])`

    Creates a module. If there is a table in `package.loaded[name]`, this table is the module. Otherwise, if there is a global table `t` with the given name, this table is the module. Otherwise creates a new table `t` and sets it as the value of the global `name` and the value of `package.loaded[name]`. This function also initializes `t._NAME` with the given name, `t._M` with the module (`t` itself), and `t._PACKAGE` with the package name (the full module name minus last component; see below). Finally, `module` sets `t` as the new environment of the current function and the new value of `package.loaded[name]`, so that [`require`](#pdf-require) returns `t`.

    If `name` is a compound name (that is, one with components separated by dots), `module` creates (or reuses, if they already exist) tables for each component. For instance, if `name` is `a.b.c`, then `module` stores the module table in field `c` of field `b` of global `a`.

    This function can receive optional *options* after the module name, where each option is a function to be applied over the module.
- name: next()
  summary: Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table
  description: |-
    ### `next (table [, index])`

    Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is a table and its second argument is an index in this table. `next` returns the next index of the table and its associated value. When called with **nil** as its second argument, `next` returns an initial index and its associated value. When called with the last index, or with **nil** in an empty table, `next` returns **nil**. If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as **nil**. In particular, you can use `next(t)` to check whether a table is empty.

    The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, *even for numeric indices*. (To traverse a table in numeric order, use a numerical **for** or the [`ipairs`](#pdf-ipairs) function.)

    The behavior of `next` is *undefined* if, during the traversal, you assign any value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify existing fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.
- name: os.clock()
  summary: Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by the program
  description: |-
    ### `os.clock ()`

    Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by the program.
- name: os.date()
  summary: Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to the given string format
  description: |-
    ### `os.date ([format [, time]])`

    Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to the given string `format`.

    If the `time` argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see the [`os.time`](#pdf-os.time) function for a description of this value). Otherwise, `date` formats the current time.

    If `format` starts with '`!`', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal Time. After this optional character, if `format` is the string "`*t`", then `date` returns a table with the following fields: `year` (four digits), `month` (1--12), `day` (1--31), `hour` (0--23), `min` (0--59), `sec` (0--61), `wday` (weekday, Sunday is 1), `yday` (day of the year), and `isdst` (daylight saving flag, a boolean).

    If `format` is not "`*t`", then `date` returns the date as a string, formatted according to the same rules as the C function `strftime`.

    When called without arguments, `date` returns a reasonable date and time representation that depends on the host system and on the current locale (that is, `os.date()` is equivalent to `os.date("%c")`).
- name: os.difftime()
  summary: Returns the number of seconds from time t1 to time t2
  description: |-
    ### `os.difftime (t2, t1)`

    Returns the number of seconds from time `t1` to time `t2`. In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this value is exactly `t2`*-*`t1`.
- name: os.execute()
  summary: This function is equivalent to the C function system
  description: |-
    ### `os.execute ([command])`

    This function is equivalent to the C function `system`. It passes `command` to be executed by an operating system shell. It returns a status code, which is system-dependent. If `command` is absent, then it returns nonzero if a shell is available and zero otherwise.
- name: os.exit()
  summary: Calls the C function exit, with an optional code, to terminate the host program
  description: |-
    ### `os.exit ([code])`

- name: os.remove()
  summary: Deletes the file or directory with the given name
  description: |-
    ### `os.remove (filename)`

    Deletes the file or directory with the given name. Directories must be empty to be removed. If this function fails, it returns **nil**, plus a string describing the error.
- name: os.rename()
  summary: Renames file or directory named oldname to newname
  description: |-
    ### `os.rename (oldname, newname)`

    Renames file or directory named `oldname` to `newname`. If this function fails, it returns **nil**, plus a string describing the error.
- name: os.setlocale()
  summary: Sets the current locale of the program
  description: |-
    ### `os.setlocale (locale [, category])`

    Sets the current locale of the program. `locale` is a string specifying a locale; `category` is an optional string describing which category to change: `"all"`, `"collate"`, `"ctype"`, `"monetary"`, `"numeric"`, or `"time"`; the default category is `"all"`. The function returns the name of the new locale, or **nil** if the request cannot be honored.

    If `locale` is the empty string, the current locale is set to an implementation-defined native locale. If `locale` is the string "`C`", the current locale is set to the standard C locale.

    When called with **nil** as the first argument, this function only returns the name of the current locale for the given category.
- name: os.time()
  summary: Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing the date and time specified by the given table
  description: |-
    ### `os.time ([table])`

    Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing the date and time specified by the given table. This table must have fields `year`, `month`, and `day`, and may have fields `hour`, `min`, `sec`, and `isdst` (for a description of these fields, see the [`os.date`](#pdf-os.date) function).

    The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of seconds since some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the meaning is not specified, and the number returned by `time` can be used only as an argument to `date` and `difftime`.
- name: os.tmpname()
  summary: Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file
  description: |-
    ### `os.tmpname ()`

    Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file. The file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed when no longer needed.

    On some systems (POSIX), this function also creates a file with that name, to avoid security risks. (Someone else might create the file with wrong permissions in the time between getting the name and creating the file.) You still have to open the file to use it and to remove it (even if you do not use it).

    When possible, you may prefer to use [`io.tmpfile`](#pdf-io.tmpfile), which automatically removes the file when the program ends.

    ### `package.loaded`

    A table used by [`require`](#pdf-require) to control which modules are already loaded. When you require a module `modname` and `package.loaded[modname]` is not false, [`require`](#pdf-require) simply returns the value stored there.
- name: package.loaders
  summary: A table used by require to control how to load modules
  description: |-
    ### `package.loaders`

    A table used by [`require`](#pdf-require) to control how to load modules.

    Each entry in this table is a *searcher function*. When looking for a module, [`require`](#pdf-require) calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the module name (the argument given to [`require`](#pdf-require)) as its sole parameter. The function can return another function (the module *loader*) or a string explaining why it did not find that module (or **nil** if it has nothing to say). Lua initializes this table with four functions.

    The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the [`package.preload`](#pdf-package.preload) table.

    The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored at [`package.path`](#pdf-package.path). A path is a sequence of *templates* separated by semicolons. For each template, the searcher will change each interrogation mark in the template by `filename`, which is the module name with each dot replaced by a "directory separator" (such as "`/`" in Unix); then it will try to open the resulting file name. So, for instance, if the Lua path is the string

    ```
    "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"
    ```

    the search for a Lua file for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.lua`, `./foo.lc`, and `/usr/local/foo/init.lua`, in that order.

    The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by the variable [`package.cpath`](#pdf-package.cpath). For instance, if the C path is the string

    ```
    "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"
    ```

    the searcher for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.so`, `./foo.dll`, and `/usr/local/foo/init.so`, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as the loader. The name of this C function is the string "`luaopen_`" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is `a.v1-b.c`, the function name will be `luaopen_b_c`.

    The fourth searcher tries an *all-in-one loader*. It searches the C path for a library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring `a.b.c`, it will search for a C library for `a`. If found, it looks into it for an open function for the submodule; in our example, that would be `luaopen_a_b_c`. With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its original open function.

  summary: Dynamically links the host program with the C library libname
  description: |-
    ### `package.loadlib (libname, funcname)`

    Dynamically links the host program with the C library `libname`. Inside this library, looks for a function `funcname` and returns this function as a C function. (So, `funcname` must follow the protocol (see [`lua_CFunction`](#lua_CFunction))).

    This is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module system. Unlike [`require`](#pdf-require), it does not perform any path searching and does not automatically adds extensions. `libname` must be the complete file name of the C library, including if necessary a path and extension. `funcname` must be the exact name exported by the C library (which may depend on the C compiler and linker used).

    This function is not supported by ANSI C. As such, it is only available on some platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD, plus other Unix systems that support the `dlfcn` standard).

- name: Patterns
  summary: A character class is used to represent a set of characters
  description: |-
    ### 5.4.1 – Patterns

    #### Character Class:

    A *character class* is used to represent a set of characters. The following combinations are allowed in describing a character class:

    - ***x*:** (where *x* is not one of the *magic characters* `^$()%.[]*+-?`) represents the character *x* itself.

    - `.`: (a dot) represents all characters.

    - `%a`: represents all letters.

    - `%c`: represents all control characters.

    - `%d`: represents all digits.

    - `%l`: represents all lowercase letters.

    - `%p`: represents all punctuation characters.

    - `%s`: represents all space characters.

    - `%u`: represents all uppercase letters.

    - `%w`: represents all alphanumeric characters.

    - `%x`: represents all hexadecimal digits.

    - `%z`: represents the character with representation 0.

    - `%`*`x`*: (where *x* is any non-alphanumeric character) represents the character *x*. This is the standard way to escape the magic characters. Any punctuation character (even the non magic) can be preceded by a '`%`' when used to represent itself in a pattern.

    - `[`*`set`*`]`: represents the class which is the union of all characters in *set*. A range of characters can be specified by separating the end characters of the range with a '`-`'. All classes `%`*x* described above can also be used as components in *set*. All other characters in *set* represent themselves. For example, `[%w_]` (or `[_%w]`) represents all alphanumeric characters plus the underscore, `[0-7]` represents the octal digits, and `[0-7%l%-]` represents the octal digits plus the lowercase letters plus the '`-`' character.

      The interaction between ranges and classes is not defined. Therefore, patterns like `[%a-z]` or `[a-%%]` have no meaning.

    - `[^`*`set`*`]`: represents the complement of *set*, where *set* is interpreted as above.

    For all classes represented by single letters (`%a`, `%c`, etc.), the corresponding uppercase letter represents the complement of the class. For instance, `%S` represents all non-space characters.

    The definitions of letter, space, and other character groups depend on the current locale. In particular, the class `[a-z]` may not be equivalent to `%l`.

    #### Pattern Item:

    A *pattern item* can be

    - a single character class, which matches any single character in the class;
    - a single character class followed by '`*`', which matches 0 or more repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always match the longest possible sequence;
    - a single character class followed by '`+`', which matches 1 or more repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always match the longest possible sequence;
    - a single character class followed by '`-`', which also matches 0 or more repetitions of characters in the class. Unlike '`*`', these repetition items will always match the *shortest* possible sequence;
    - a single character class followed by '`?`', which matches 0 or 1 occurrence of a character in the class;
    - `%`*`n`*, for *n* between 1 and 9; such item matches a substring equal to the *n*-th captured string (see below);
    - `%b`*`xy`*, where *x* and *y* are two distinct characters; such item matches strings that start with *x*, end with *y*, and where the *x* and *y* are *balanced*. This means that, if one reads the string from left to right, counting *+1* for an *x* and *-1* for a *y*, the ending *y* is the first *y* where the count reaches 0. For instance, the item `%b()` matches expressions with balanced parentheses.

    #### Pattern:

    A *pattern* is a sequence of pattern items. A '`^`' at the beginning of a pattern anchors the match at the beginning of the subject string. A '`$`' at the end of a pattern anchors the match at the end of the subject string. At other positions, '`^`' and '`$`' have no special meaning and represent themselves.

    #### Captures:

    A pattern can contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses; they describe *captures*. When a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string that match captures are stored (*captured*) for future use. Captures are numbered according to their left parentheses. For instance, in the pattern `"(a*(.)%w(%s*))"`, the part of the string matching `"a*(.)%w(%s*)"` is stored as the first capture (and therefore has number 1); the character matching "`.`" is captured with number 2, and the part matching "`%s*`" has number 3.

    As a special case, the empty capture `()` captures the current string position (a number). For instance, if we apply the pattern `"()aa()"` on the string `"flaaap"`, there will be two captures: 3 and 5.

    A pattern cannot contain embedded zeros. Use `%z` instead.
- name: pcall()
  summary: Calls function f with the given arguments in protected mode
  description: |-
    ### `pcall (f, arg1, ···)`

    Calls function `f` with the given arguments in *protected mode*. This means that any error inside `f` is not propagated; instead, `pcall` catches the error and returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case, `pcall` also returns all results from the call, after this first result. In case of any error, `pcall` returns **false** plus the error message.

- name: Relational Operators
  summary: The relational operators in Lua are
  description: |-
    ### 2.5.2 – Relational Operators

    The relational operators in Lua are

    ```
    ==    ~=    <     >     <=    >=
    ```

    These operators always result in **false** or **true**.

    Equality (`==`) first compares the type of its operands. If the types are different, then the result is **false**. Otherwise, the values of the operands are compared. Numbers and strings are compared in the usual way. Objects (tables, userdata, threads, and functions) are compared by *reference*: two objects are considered equal only if they are the *same* object. Every time you create a new object (a table, userdata, thread, or function), this new object is different from any previously existing object.

    You can change the way that Lua compares tables and userdata by using the "eq" metamethod (see [§2.8](#2.8)).

    The conversion rules of [§2.2.1](#2.2.1) *do not* apply to equality comparisons. Thus, `"0"==0` evaluates to **false**, and `t[0]` and `t["0"]` denote different entries in a table.

    The operator `~=` is exactly the negation of equality (`==`).

    The order operators work as follows. If both arguments are numbers, then they are compared as such. Otherwise, if both arguments are strings, then their values are compared according to the current locale. Otherwise, Lua tries to call the "lt" or the "le" metamethod (see [§2.8](#2.8)). A comparison `a > b` is translated to `b < a` and `a >= b` is translated to `b <= a`.
- name: require()
  summary: Loads the given module
  description: |-
    ### `require (modname)`

    Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the [`package.loaded`](#pdf-package.loaded) table to determine whether `modname` is already loaded. If it is, then `require` returns the value stored at `package.loaded[modname]`. Otherwise, it tries to find a *loader* for the module.

    To find a loader, `require` is guided by the [`package.loaders`](#pdf-package.loaders) array. By changing this array, we can change how `require` looks for a module. The following explanation is based on the default configuration for [`package.loaders`](#pdf-package.loaders).

    First `require` queries `package.preload[modname]`. If it has a value, this value (which should be a function) is the loader. Otherwise `require` searches for a Lua loader using the path stored in [`package.path`](#pdf-package.path). If that also fails, it searches for a C loader using the path stored in [`package.cpath`](#pdf-package.cpath). If that also fails, it tries an *all-in-one* loader (see [`package.loaders`](#pdf-package.loaders)).

    Once a loader is found, `require` calls the loader with a single argument, `modname`. If the loader returns any value, `require` assigns the returned value to `package.loaded[modname]`. If the loader returns no value and has not assigned any value to `package.loaded[modname]`, then `require` assigns **true** to this entry. In any case, `require` returns the final value of `package.loaded[modname]`.

    If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any loader for the module, then `require` signals an error.

    ### `setfenv (f, table)`

    Sets the environment to be used by the given function. `f` can be a Lua function or a number that specifies the function at that stack level: Level 1 is the function calling `setfenv`. `setfenv` returns the given function.

    As a special case, when `f` is 0 `setfenv` changes the environment of the running thread. In this case, `setfenv` returns no values.

- name: string.find()
  summary: If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values are also returned, after the two indices
  description: |-
    ### `string.find (s, pattern [, init [, plain]])`

    Looks for the first match of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it finds a match, then `find` returns the indices of `s` where this occurrence starts and ends; otherwise, it returns **nil**. A third, optional numerical argument `init` specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative. A value of **true** as a fourth, optional argument `plain` turns off the pattern matching facilities, so the function does a plain "find substring" operation, with no characters in `pattern` being considered "magic". Note that if `plain` is given, then `init` must be given as well.

    If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values are also returned, after the two indices.
- name: string.format()
  summary: 'will produce the string:'
  description: |-
    ### `string.format (formatstring, ···)`

    Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following the description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The format string follows the same rules as the `printf` family of standard C functions. The only differences are that the options/modifiers `*`, `l`, `L`, `n`, `p`, and `h` are not supported and that there is an extra option, `q`. The `q` option formats a string in a form suitable to be safely read back by the Lua interpreter: the string is written between double quotes, and all double quotes, newlines, embedded zeros, and backslashes in the string are correctly escaped when written. For instance, the call

    ```
    string.format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new line')
    ```

    will produce the string:

    ```
    "a string with \"quotes\" and \
     new line"
    ```

    The options `c`, `d`, `E`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `G`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `X`, and `x` all expect a number as argument, whereas `q` and `s` expect a string.

    This function does not accept string values containing embedded zeros, except as arguments to the `q` option.
- name: string.gmatch()
  summary: As an example, the following loop
  description: |-
    ### `string.gmatch (s, pattern)`

    Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the next captures from `pattern` over string `s`. If `pattern` specifies no captures, then the whole match is produced in each call.

    As an example, the following loop

    ```
    s = "hello world from Lua"
    for w in string.gmatch(s, "%a+") do
      print(w)
    end
    ```

    will iterate over all the words from string `s`, printing one per line. The next example collects all pairs `key=value` from the given string into a table:

    ```
    t = {}
    s = "from=world, to=Lua"
    for k, v in string.gmatch(s, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do
      t[k] = v
    end
    ```

    For this function, a '`^`' at the start of a pattern does not work as an anchor, as this would prevent the iteration.
- name: string.gsub()
  summary: If repl is a string, then its value is used for replacement
  description: |-
    ### `string.gsub (s, pattern, repl [, n])`

    Returns a copy of `s` in which all (or the first `n`, if given) occurrences of the `pattern` have been replaced by a replacement string specified by `repl`, which can be a string, a table, or a function. `gsub` also returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that occurred.

    If `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character `%` works as an escape character: any sequence in `repl` of the form `%`*`n`*, with *n* between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the *n*-th captured substring (see below). The sequence `%0` stands for the whole match. The sequence `%%` stands for a single `%`.

    If `repl` is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the first capture as the key; if the pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is used as the key.

    If `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a match occurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order; if the pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is passed as a sole argument.

    If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is **false** or **nil**, then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is kept in the string).

    Here are some examples:

    ```
    x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")
    --> x="hello hello world world"

    x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)
    --> x="hello hello world"

    x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")
    --> x="world hello Lua from"

    x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)

    x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)
          return loadstring(s)()
        end)
    --> x="4+5 = 9"

    local t = {name="lua", version="5.1"}

- name: Table Constructors
  summary: Table constructors are expressions that create tables
  description: |-
    ### 2.5.7 – Table Constructors

    Table constructors are expressions that create tables. Every time a constructor is evaluated, a new table is created. A constructor can be used to create an empty table or to create a table and initialize some of its fields. The general syntax for constructors is

    ```
    tableconstructor ::= `{´ [fieldlist] `}´
    fieldlist ::= field {fieldsep field} [fieldsep]
    field ::= `[´ exp `]´ `=´ exp | Name `=´ exp | exp
    fieldsep ::= `,´ | `;´
    ```

    Each field of the form `[exp1] = exp2` adds to the new table an entry with key `exp1` and value `exp2`. A field of the form `name = exp` is equivalent to `["name"] = exp`. Finally, fields of the form `exp` are equivalent to `[i] = exp`, where `i` are consecutive numerical integers, starting with 1. Fields in the other formats do not affect this counting. For example,

    ```
    a = { [f(1)] = g; "x", "y"; x = 1, f(x), [30] = 23; 45 }
    ```

    is equivalent to

    ```
    do
      local t = {}
      t[f(1)] = g
      t[1] = "x"         -- 1st exp
      t[2] = "y"         -- 2nd exp
      t.x = 1            -- t["x"] = 1
      t[3] = f(x)        -- 3rd exp
      t[30] = 23
      t[4] = 45          -- 4th exp
      a = t
    end
    ```

    If the last field in the list has the form `exp` and the expression is a function call or a vararg expression, then all values returned by this expression enter the list consecutively (see [§2.5.8](#2.5.8)). To avoid this, enclose the function call or the vararg expression in parentheses (see [§2.5](#2.5)).

    The field list can have an optional trailing separator, as a convenience for machine-generated code.

If `comp` is given, then it must be a function that receives two table elements, and returns true when the first is less than the second (so that `not comp(a[i+1],a[i])` will be true after the sort). If `comp` is not given, then the standard Lua operator `<` is used instead.

    The sort algorithm is not stable; that is, elements considered equal by the given order may have their relative positions changed by the sort.

    ### 2.5.5 – The Length Operator

    The length operator is denoted by the unary operator `#`. The length of a string is its number of bytes (that is, the usual meaning of string length when each character is one byte).

    The length of a table `t` is defined to be any integer index `n` such that `t[n]` is not **nil** and `t[n+1]` is **nil**; moreover, if `t[1]` is **nil**, `n` can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given `n`, its length is exactly that `n`, the index of its last value. If the array has "holes" (that is, **nil** values between other non-nil values), then `#t` can be any of the indices that directly precedes a **nil** value (that is, it may consider any such **nil** value as the end of the array).
- name: tonumber()
  summary: An optional argument specifies the base to interpret the numeral
  description: |-
    ### `tonumber (e [, base])`

    Tries to convert its argument to a number. If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a number, then `tonumber` returns this number; otherwise, it returns **nil**.

    An optional argument specifies the base to interpret the numeral. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter '`A`' (in either upper or lower case) represents 10, '`B`' represents 11, and so forth, with '`Z`' representing 35. In base 10 (the default), the number can have a decimal part, as well as an optional exponent part (see [§2.1](#2.1)). In other bases, only unsigned integers are accepted.

  summary: If the metatable of e has a "__tostring" field, then tostring calls the corresponding value with e as argument, and uses the result of the call as its result
  description: |-
    ### `tostring (e)`

    Receives an argument of any type and converts it to a string in a reasonable format. For complete control of how numbers are converted, use [`string.format`](#pdf-string.format).

    If the metatable of `e` has a `"__tostring"` field, then `tostring` calls the corresponding value with `e` as argument, and uses the result of the call as its result.

    ### `type (v)`

    Returns the type of its only argument, coded as a string. The possible results of this function are "`nil`" (a string, not the value **nil**), "`number`", "`string`", "`boolean`", "`table`", "`function`", "`thread`", and "`userdata`".
- name: unpack()

  description: |-
    ### `unpack (list [, i [, j]])`

    Returns the elements from the given table. This function is equivalent to

    ```
    return list[i], list[i+1], ···, list[j]
    ```

    except that the above code can be written only for a fixed number of elements. By default, `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of the list, as defined by the length operator (see [§2.5.5](#2.5.5)).
- name: Values and Types
  summary: Lua is a dynamically typed language
  description: |-
    ## 2.2 – Values and Types

    Lua is a *dynamically typed language*. This means that variables do not have types; only values do. There are no type definitions in the language. All values carry their own type.

    All values in Lua are *first-class values*. This means that all values can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.

    There are eight basic types in Lua: *nil*, *boolean*, *number*, *string*, *function*, *userdata*, *thread*, and *table*. *Nil* is the type of the value **nil**, whose main property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents the absence of a useful value. *Boolean* is the type of the values **false** and **true**. Both **nil** and **false** make a condition false; any other value makes it true. *Number* represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers. (It is easy to build Lua interpreters that use other internal representations for numbers, such as single-precision float or long integers; see file `luaconf.h`.) *String* represents arrays of characters. Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can contain any 8-bit character, including embedded zeros ('`\0`') (see [§2.1](#2.1)).

    Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written in C (see [§2.5.8](#2.5.8)).

    The type *userdata* is provided to allow arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua variables. This type corresponds to a block of raw memory and has no pre-defined operations in Lua, except assignment and identity test. However, by using *metatables*, the programmer can define operations for userdata values (see [§2.8](#2.8)). Userdata values cannot be created or modified in Lua, only through the C API. This guarantees the integrity of data owned by the host program.

    The type *thread* represents independent threads of execution and it is used to implement coroutines (see [§2.11](#2.11)). Do not confuse Lua threads with operating-system threads. Lua supports coroutines on all systems, even those that do not support threads.

    The type *table* implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be indexed not only with numbers, but with any value (except **nil**). Tables can be *heterogeneous*; that is, they can contain values of all types (except **nil**). Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to represent ordinary arrays, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc. To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index. The language supports this representation by providing `a.name` as syntactic sugar for `a["name"]`. There are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see [§2.5.7](#2.5.7)).

    Like indices, the value of a table field can be of any type (except **nil**). In particular, because functions are first-class values, table fields can contain functions. Thus tables can also carry *methods* (see [§2.5.9](#2.5.9)).

    Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are *objects*: variables do not actually *contain* these values, only *references* to them. Assignment, parameter passing, and function returns always manipulate references to such values; these operations do not imply any kind of copy.

    The library function [`type`](#pdf-type) returns a string describing the type of a given value.
- name: Variables
  summary: Variables are places that store values
  description: |-
    ## 2.3 – Variables

    Variables are places that store values. There are three kinds of variables in Lua: global variables, local variables, and table fields.

    A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a function's formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable):

    ```
    var ::= Name
    ```

    Name denotes identifiers, as defined in [§2.1](#2.1).

    Any variable is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as a local (see [§2.4.7](#2.4.7)). Local variables are *lexically scoped*: local variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope (see [§2.6](#2.6)).

    Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is **nil**.

    Square brackets are used to index a table:

    ```
    var ::= prefixexp `[´ exp `]´
    ```

    The meaning of accesses to global variables and table fields can be changed via metatables. An access to an indexed variable `t[i]` is equivalent to a call `gettable_event(t,i)`. (See [§2.8](#2.8) for a complete description of the `gettable_event` function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)

    The syntax `var.Name` is just syntactic sugar for `var["Name"]`:

    ```
    var ::= prefixexp `.´ Name
    ```

    All global variables live as fields in ordinary Lua tables, called *environment tables* or simply *environments* (see [§2.9](#2.9)). Each function has its own reference to an environment, so that all global variables in this function will refer to this environment table. When a function is created, it inherits the environment from the function that created it. To get the environment table of a Lua function, you call [`getfenv`](#pdf-getfenv). To replace it, you call [`setfenv`](#pdf-setfenv). (You can only manipulate the environment of C functions through the debug library; (see [§5.9](#5.9)).)

    An access to a global variable `x` is equivalent to `_env.x`, which in turn is equivalent to

    ```
    gettable_event(_env, "x")
    ```

    where `_env` is the environment of the running function. (See [§2.8](#2.8) for a complete description of the `gettable_event` function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. Similarly, the `_env` variable is not defined in Lua. We use them here only for explanatory purposes.)
- name: Visibility Rules
  summary: Lua is a lexically scoped language
  description: |-
    ## 2.6 – Visibility Rules

    Lua is a lexically scoped language. The scope of variables begins at the first statement *after* their declaration and lasts until the end of the innermost block that includes the declaration. Consider the following example:

    ```
    x = 10                -- global variable
    do                    -- new block
      local x = x         -- new 'x', with value 10
      print(x)            --> 10
      x = x+1
      do                  -- another block
        local x = x+1     -- another 'x'
        print(x)          --> 12
      end
      print(x)            --> 11
    end
    print(x)              --> 10  (the global one)
    ```

    Notice that, in a declaration like `local x = x`, the new `x` being declared is not in scope yet, and so the second `x` refers to the outside variable.

    Because of the lexical scoping rules, local variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope. A local variable used by an inner function is called an *upvalue*, or *external local variable*, inside the inner function.

    Notice that each execution of a **local** statement defines new local variables. Consider the following example:

    ```
    a = {}
    local x = 20
    for i=1,10 do
      local y = 0
      a[i] = function () y=y+1; return x+y end
    end
    ```

    The loop creates ten closures (that is, ten instances of the anonymous function). Each of these closures uses a different `y` variable, while all of them share the same `x`.
- name: Weak Tables
  summary: A weak table is a table whose elements are weak references
  description: |-
    ### 2.10.2 – Weak Tables

    A *weak table* is a table whose elements are *weak references*. A weak reference is ignored by the garbage collector. In other words, if the only references to an object are weak references, then the garbage collector will collect this object.

    A weak table can have weak keys, weak values, or both. A table with weak keys allows the collection of its keys, but prevents the collection of its values. A table with both weak keys and weak values allows the collection of both keys and values. In any case, if either the key or the value is collected, the whole pair is removed from the table. The weakness of a table is controlled by the `__mode` field of its metatable. If the `__mode` field is a string containing the character '`k`', the keys in the table are weak. If `__mode` contains '`v`', the values in the table are weak.

    After you use a table as a metatable, you should not change the value of its `__mode` field. Otherwise, the weak behavior of the tables controlled by this metatable is undefined.
- name: xpcall()
  summary: This function is similar to pcall, except that you can set a new error handler
  description: |-
    ### `xpcall (f, err)`

    This function is similar to [`pcall`](#pdf-pcall), except that you can set a new error handler.

    `xpcall` calls function `f` in protected mode, using `err` as the error handler. Any error inside `f` is not propagated; instead, `xpcall` catches the error, calls the `err` function with the original error object, and returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In this case, `xpcall` also returns all results from the call, after this first result. In case of any error, `xpcall` returns **false** plus the result from `err`.
- name: _G
  summary: ''
  description: |-
    ### `_G`

    A global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment (that is, `_G._G = _G`). Lua itself does not use this variable; changing its value does not affect any environment, nor vice-versa. (Use [`setfenv`](#pdf-setfenv) to change environments.)
- name: _VERSION
  summary: ''
  description: |-
    ### `_VERSION`

    A global variable (not a function) that holds a string containing the current interpreter version. The current contents of this variable is "`Lua 5.1`".
