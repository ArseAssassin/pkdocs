If a category name is given, the command shows all the Redis commands in the specified category.\n\nACL categories are very useful in order to create ACL rules that include or exclude a large set of commands at once, without specifying every single command. For instance, the following rule will let the user `karin` perform everything but the most dangerous operations that may affect the server stability:\n\n    ACL SETUSER karin on +@all -@dangerous\n\nWe first add all the commands to the set of commands that `karin` is able to execute, but then we remove all the dangerous commands.\n\nChecking for all the available categories is as simple as:\n\n```\n> ACL CAT\n 1) \"keyspace\"\n 2) \"read\"\n 3) \"write\"\n 4) \"set\"\n 5) \"sortedset\"\n 6) \"list\"\n 7) \"hash\"\n 8) \"string\"\n 9) \"bitmap\"\n10) \"hyperloglog\"\n11) \"geo\"\n12) \"stream\"\n13) \"pubsub\"\n14) \"admin\"\n15) \"fast\"\n16) \"slow\"\n17) \"blocking\"\n18) \"dangerous\"\n19) \"connection\"\n20) \"transaction\"\n21) \"scripting\"\n```\n\nThen we may want to know what commands are part of a given category:\n\n```\n> ACL CAT dangerous\n 1) \"flushdb\"\n 2) \"acl\"\n 3) \"slowlog\"\n 4) \"debug\"\n 5) \"role\"\n 6) \"keys\"\n 7) \"pfselftest\"\n 8) \"client\"\n 9) \"bgrewriteaof\"\n10) \"replicaof\"\n11) \"monitor\"\n12) \"restore-asking\"\n13) \"latency\"\n14) \"replconf\"\n15) \"pfdebug\"\n16) \"bgsave\"\n17) \"sync\"\n18) \"config\"\n19) \"flushall\"\n20) \"cluster\"\n21) \"info\"\n22) \"lastsave\"\n23) \"slaveof\"\n24) \"swapdb\"\n25) \"module\"\n26) \"restore\"\n27) \"migrate\"\n28) \"save\"\n29) \"shutdown\"\n30) \"psync\"\n31) \"sort\"\n```\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): a list of ACL categories or a list of commands inside a given category.

  summary: ACL users need a solid password in order to authenticate to the server without security risks
  description: "# ACL\n\n    ACL GENPASS\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nACL GENPASS [bits]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n6.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@slow`,\n\nACL users need a solid password in order to authenticate to the server without security risks. Such password does not need to be remembered by humans, but only by computers, so it can be very long and strong (unguessable by an external attacker). The `ACL GENPASS` command generates a password starting from /dev/urandom if available, otherwise (in systems without /dev/urandom) it uses a weaker system that is likely still better than picking a weak password by hand.\n\nBy default (if /dev/urandom is available) the password is strong and can be used for other uses in the context of a Redis application, for instance in order to create unique session identifiers or other kind of unguessable and not colliding IDs. The password generation is also very cheap because we don't really ask /dev/urandom for bits at every execution. At startup Redis creates a seed using /dev/urandom, then it will use SHA256 in counter mode, with HMAC-SHA256(seed,counter) as primitive, in order to create more random bytes as needed. This means that the application developer should be feel free to abuse `ACL GENPASS` to create as many secure pseudorandom strings as needed.\n\nThe command output is a hexadecimal representation of a binary string. By default it emits 256 bits (so 64 hex characters). The user can provide an argument in form of number of bits to emit from 1 to 1024 to change the output length. Note that the number of bits provided is always rounded to the next multiple of 4. So for instance asking for just 1 bit password will result in 4 bits to be emitted, in the form of a single hex character.\n\n## Return\n\n[Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings): by default 64 bytes string representing 256 bits of pseudorandom data. Otherwise if an argument if needed, the output string length is the number of specified bits (rounded to the next multiple of 4) divided by 4.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n> ACL GENPASS\n\"dd721260bfe1b3d9601e7fbab36de6d04e2e67b0ef1c53de59d45950db0dd3cc\"\n\n> ACL GENPASS 32\n\"355ef3dd\"\n\n> ACL GENPASS 5\n\"90\"\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/acl-genpass/](https://redis.io/commands/acl-genpass/)"

Where N is the number of rules provided.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\nCreate an ACL user with the specified rules or modify the rules of an existing user.\n\nManipulate Redis ACL users interactively. If the username does not exist, the command creates the username without any privilege. It then reads from left to right all the [rules](#acl-rules) provided as successive arguments, setting the user ACL rules as specified. If the user already exists, the provided ACL rules are simply applied *in addition* to the rules already set. For example:\n\n    ACL SETUSER virginia on allkeys +set\n\nThe above command creates a user called `virginia` who is active(the *on* rule), can access any key (*allkeys* rule), and can call the set command (*+set* rule). Then, you can use another `ACL SETUSER` call to modify the user rules:\n\n    ACL SETUSER virginia +get\n\nThe above rule applies the new rule to the user `virginia`, so other than [`SET`](../set), the user `virginia` can now also use the [`GET`](../get) command.\n\nStarting from Redis 7.0, ACL rules can also be grouped into multiple distinct sets of rules, called *selectors*. Selectors are added by wrapping the rules in parentheses and providing them just like any other rule. In order to execute a command, either the root permissions (rules defined outside of parenthesis) or any of the selectors (rules defined inside parenthesis) must match the given command. For example:\n\n    ACL SETUSER virginia on +GET allkeys (+SET ~app1*)\n\nThis sets a user with two sets of permissions, one defined on the user and one defined with a selector. The root user permissions only allow executing the get command, but can be executed on any keys. The selector then grants a secondary set of permissions: access to the [`SET`](../set) command to be executed on any key that starts with `app1`. Using multiple selectors allows you to grant permissions that are different depending on what keys are being accessed.\n\nWhen we want to be sure to define a user from scratch, without caring if it had previously defined rules associated, we can use the special rule `reset` as first rule, in order to flush all the other existing rules:\n\n    ACL SETUSER antirez reset [... other rules ...]\n\nAfter resetting a user, its ACL rules revert to the default: inactive, passwordless, can't execute any command nor access any key or channel:\n\n    > ACL SETUSER antirez reset\n    +OK\n    > ACL LIST\n    1) \"user antirez off -@all\"\n\nACL rules are either words like \"on\", \"off\", \"reset\", \"allkeys\", or are special rules that start with a special character, and are followed by another string (without any space in between), like \"+SET\".\n\nThe following documentation is a reference manual about the capabilities of this command, however our [ACL tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/acl) may be a more gentle introduction to how the ACL system works in general.\n\n## ACL rules\n\nRedis ACL rules are split into two categories: rules that define command permissions or *command rules*, and rules that define the user state or *user management rules*. This is a list of all the supported Redis ACL rules:\n\n### Command rules\n\n- `~<pattern>`: Adds the specified key pattern (glob style pattern, like in the [`KEYS`](../keys) command), to the list of key patterns accessible by the user. This grants both read and write permissions to keys that match the pattern. You can add multiple key patterns to the same user. Example: `~objects:*`\n- `%R~<pattern>`: (Available in Redis 7.0 and later) Adds the specified read key pattern. This behaves similar to the regular key pattern but only grants permission to read from keys that match the given pattern. See [key permissions](https://redis.io/topics/acl#key-permissions) for more information.\n- `%W~<pattern>`: (Available in Redis 7.0 and later) Adds the specified write key pattern. This behaves similar to the regular key pattern but only grants permission to write to keys that match the given pattern. See [key permissions](https://redis.io/topics/acl#key-permissions) for more information.\n- `%RW~<pattern>`: (Available in Redis 7.0 and later) Alias for `~<pattern>`.\n- `allkeys`: Alias for `~*`, it allows the user to access all the keys.\n- `resetkeys`: Removes all the key patterns from the list of key patterns the user can access.\n- `&<pattern>`: (Available in Redis 6.2 and later) Adds the specified glob style pattern to the list of Pub/Sub channel patterns accessible by the user. You can add multiple channel patterns to the same user. Example: `&chatroom:*`\n- `allchannels`: Alias for `&*`, it allows the user to access all Pub/Sub channels.\n- `resetchannels`: Removes all channel patterns from the list of Pub/Sub channel patterns the user can access.\n- `+<command>`: Adds the command to the list of commands the user can call. Can be used with `|` for allowing subcommands (e.g \"+config\\|get\").\n- `+@<category>`: Adds all the commands in the specified category to the list of commands the user is able to execute. Example: `+@string` (adds all the string commands). For a list of categories, check the [`ACL CAT`](../acl-cat) command.\n- `+<command>|first-arg`: Allows a specific first argument of an otherwise disabled command. It is only supported on commands with no sub-commands, and is not allowed as negative form like -SELECT\\|1, only additive starting with \"+\". This feature is deprecated and may be removed in the future.\n- `allcommands`: Alias of `+@all`. Adds all the commands there are in the server, including *future commands* loaded via module, to be executed by this user.\n- `-<command>`: Remove the command to the list of commands the user can call. Starting Redis 7.0, it can be used with `|` for blocking subcommands (e.g., \"-config\\|set\").\n- `-@<category>`: Like `+@<category>` but removes all the commands in the category instead of adding them.\n- `nocommands`: Alias for `-@all`. Removes all the commands, and the user is no longer able to execute anything.\n\n### User management rules\n\n- `on`: Set the user as active, it will be possible to authenticate as this user using `AUTH <username> <password>`.\n- `off`: Set user as not active, it will be impossible to log as this user. Please note that if a user gets disabled (set to off) after there are connections already authenticated with such a user, the connections will continue to work as expected. To also kill the old connections you can use [`CLIENT KILL`](../client-kill) with the user option. An alternative is to delete the user with [`ACL DELUSER`](../acl-deluser), that will result in all the connections authenticated as the deleted user to be disconnected.\n- `nopass`: The user is set as a *no password* user. It means that it will be possible to authenticate as such user with any password. By default, the `default` special user is set as \"nopass\". The `nopass` rule will also reset all the configured passwords for the user.\n- `>password`: Adds the specified clear text password as a hashed password in the list of the users passwords. Every user can have many active passwords, so that password rotation will be simpler. The specified password is not stored as clear text inside the server. Example: `>mypassword`.\n- `#<hashedpassword>`: Adds the specified hashed password to the list of user passwords. A Redis hashed password is hashed with SHA256 and translated into a hexadecimal string. Example: `#c3ab8ff13720e8ad9047dd39466b3c8974e592c2fa383d4a3960714caef0c4f2`.\n- `<password`: Like `>password` but removes the password instead of adding it.\n- `!<hashedpassword>`: Like `#<hashedpassword>` but removes the password instead of adding it.\n- `(<rule list>)`: (Available in Redis 7.0 and later) Creates a new selector to match rules against.

The amortized time complexity is O(1) assuming the appended value is small and the already present value is of any size, since the dynamic string library used by Redis will double the free space available on every reallocation.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@string`, `@fast`,\n\nIf `key` already exists and is a string, this command appends the `value` at the end of the string. If `key` does not exist it is created and set as an empty string, so `APPEND` will be similar to [`SET`](../set) in this special case.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): the length of the string after the append operation.\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nEXISTS mykey\nAPPEND mykey \"Hello\"\nAPPEND mykey \" World\"\nGET mykey\n```\n\n## Pattern: Time series\n\nThe `APPEND` command can be used to create a very compact representation of a list of fixed-size samples, usually referred as *time series*. Every time a new sample arrives we can store it using the command\n\n```\nAPPEND timeseries \"fixed-size sample\"\n```\n\nAccessing individual elements in the time series is not hard:\n\n- [`STRLEN`](../strlen) can be used in order to obtain the number of samples.\n- [`GETRANGE`](../getrange) allows for random access of elements. If our time series have associated time information we can easily implement a binary search to get range combining [`GETRANGE`](../getrange) with the Lua scripting engine available in Redis 2.6.\n- [`SETRANGE`](../setrange) can be used to overwrite an existing time series.\n\nThe limitation of this pattern is that we are forced into an append-only mode of operation, there is no way to cut the time series to a given size easily because Redis currently lacks a command able to trim string objects. However the space efficiency of time series stored in this way is remarkable.\n\nHint: it is possible to switch to a different key based on the current Unix time, in this way it is possible to have just a relatively small amount of samples per key, to avoid dealing with very big keys, and to make this pattern more friendly to be distributed across many Redis instances.\n\nAn example sampling the temperature of a sensor using fixed-size strings (using a binary format is better in real implementations).\n\n``` redis-cli\nAPPEND ts \"0043\"\nAPPEND ts \"0035\"\nGETRANGE ts 0 3\nGETRANGE ts 4 7\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/append/](https://redis.io/commands/append/)"

By default, the filter auto-scales by creating additional sub-filters when `capacity` is reached. The new sub-filter is created with size of the previous sub-filter multiplied by `expansion`.\n\nThough the filter can scale up by creating sub-filters, it is recommended to reserve the estimated required `capacity` since maintaining and querying sub-filters requires additional memory (each sub-filter uses an extra bits and hash function) and consume further CPU time than an equivalent filter that had the right capacity at creation time.\n\nThe number of hash functions is `-log(error)/ln(2)^2`. The number of bits per item is `-log(error)/ln(2)` ≈ 1.44.\n\n- **1%** error rate requires 7 hash functions and 10.08 bits per item.\n- **0.1%** error rate requires 10 hash functions and 14.4 bits per item.\n- **0.01%** error rate requires 14 hash functions and 20.16 bits per item.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **key**: The key under which the filter is found\n- **error_rate**: The desired probability for false positives. The rate is a decimal value between 0 and 1. For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.\n- **capacity**: The number of entries intended to be added to the filter. If your filter allows scaling, performance will begin to degrade after adding more items than this number. The actual degradation depends on how far the limit has been exceeded. Performance degrades linearly with the number of `sub-filters`.\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n- **NONSCALING**: Prevents the filter from creating additional sub-filters if initial capacity is reached. Non-scaling filters requires slightly less memory than their scaling counterparts. The filter returns an error when `capacity` is reached.\n- **EXPANSION**: When `capacity` is reached, an additional sub-filter is created. The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `expansion`. If the number of elements to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an `expansion` of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters.

For instance day 0 is the first day the application was put online, day 1 the next day, and so forth.\n\nEvery time a user performs a page view, the application can register that in the current day the user visited the web site using the [`SETBIT`](../setbit) command setting the bit corresponding to the current day.\n\nLater it will be trivial to know the number of single days the user visited the web site simply calling the `BITCOUNT` command against the bitmap.\n\nA similar pattern where user IDs are used instead of days is described in the article called \"[Fast easy realtime metrics using Redis bitmaps](http://blog.getspool.com/2011/11/29/fast-easy-realtime-metrics-using-redis-bitmaps)\".\n\n## Performance considerations\n\nIn the above example of counting days, even after 10 years the application is online we still have just `365*10` bits of data per user, that is just 456 bytes per user. With this amount of data `BITCOUNT` is still as fast as any other O(1) Redis command like [`GET`](../get) or [`INCR`](../incr).\n\nWhen the bitmap is big, there are two alternatives:\n\n- Taking a separated key that is incremented every time the bitmap is modified. This can be very efficient and atomic using a small Redis Lua script.\n- Running the bitmap incrementally using the `BITCOUNT` *start* and *end* optional parameters, accumulating the results client-side, and optionally caching the result into a key.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added the `BYTE|BIT` option.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/bitcount/](https://redis.io/commands/bitcount/)"

  summary: The command treats a Redis string as an array of bits, and is capable of addressing specific integer fields of varying bit widths and arbitrary non (necessary) aligned offset
  description: "# BITFIELD\n\n    BITFIELD\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nBITFIELD key [GET encoding offset | [OVERFLOW <WRAP | SAT | FAIL>]\n  <SET encoding offset value | INCRBY encoding offset increment>\n  [GET encoding offset | [OVERFLOW <WRAP | SAT | FAIL>]\n  <SET encoding offset value | INCRBY encoding offset increment>\n  ...]]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n3.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1) for each subcommand specified\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@bitmap`, `@slow`,\n\nThe command treats a Redis string as an array of bits, and is capable of addressing specific integer fields of varying bit widths and arbitrary non (necessary) aligned offset. In practical terms using this command you can set, for example, a signed 5 bits integer at bit offset 1234 to a specific value, retrieve a 31 bit unsigned integer from offset 4567. Similarly the command handles increments and decrements of the specified integers, providing guaranteed and well specified overflow and underflow behavior that the user can configure.\n\n`BITFIELD` is able to operate with multiple bit fields in the same command call. It takes a list of operations to perform, and returns an array of replies, where each array matches the corresponding operation in the list of arguments.\n\nFor example the following command increments a 5 bit signed integer at bit offset 100, and gets the value of the 4 bit unsigned integer at bit offset 0:\n\n    > BITFIELD mykey INCRBY i5 100 1 GET u4 0\n    1) (integer) 1\n    2) (integer) 0\n\nNote that:\n\n1.  Addressing with `GET` bits outside the current string length (including the case the key does not exist at all), results in the operation to be performed like the missing part all consists of bits set to 0.\n2.  Addressing with `SET` or `INCRBY` bits outside the current string length will enlarge the string, zero-padding it, as needed, for the minimal length needed, according to the most far bit touched.\n\n## Supported subcommands and integer encoding\n\nThe following is the list of supported commands.\n\n- **GET** `<encoding>` `<offset>` -- Returns the specified bit field.\n- **SET** `<encoding>` `<offset>` `<value>` -- Set the specified bit field and returns its old value.\n- **INCRBY** `<encoding>` `<offset>` `<increment>` -- Increments or decrements (if a negative increment is given) the specified bit field and returns the new value.\n\nThere is another subcommand that only changes the behavior of successive `INCRBY` and `SET` subcommands calls by setting the overflow behavior:\n\n- **OVERFLOW** `[WRAP|SAT|FAIL]`\n\nWhere an integer encoding is expected, it can be composed by prefixing with `i` for signed integers and `u` for unsigned integers with the number of bits of our integer encoding. So for example `u8` is an unsigned integer of 8 bits and `i16` is a signed integer of 16 bits.\n\nThe supported encodings are up to 64 bits for signed integers, and up to 63 bits for unsigned integers. This limitation with unsigned integers is due to the fact that currently the Redis protocol is unable to return 64 bit unsigned integers as replies.\n\n## Bits and positional offsets\n\nThere are two ways in order to specify offsets in the bitfield command. If a number without any prefix is specified, it is used just as a zero based bit offset inside the string.\n\nHowever if the offset is prefixed with a `#` character, the specified offset is multiplied by the integer encoding's width, so for example:\n\n    BITFIELD mystring SET i8 #0 100 SET i8 #1 200\n\nWill set the first i8 integer at offset 0 and the second at offset 8. This way you don't have to do the math yourself inside your client if what you want is a plain array of integers of a given size.\n\n## Overflow control\n\nUsing the `OVERFLOW` command the user is able to fine-tune the behavior of the increment or decrement overflow (or underflow) by specifying one of the following behaviors:\n\n- **WRAP**: wrap around, both with signed and unsigned integers. In the case of unsigned integers, wrapping is like performing the operation modulo the maximum value the integer can contain (the C standard behavior). With signed integers instead wrapping means that overflows restart towards the most negative value and underflows towards the most positive ones, so for example if an `i8` integer is set to the value 127, incrementing it by 1 will yield `-128`.\n- **SAT**: uses saturation arithmetic, that is, on underflows the value is set to the minimum integer value, and on overflows to the maximum integer value. For example incrementing an `i8` integer starting from value 120 with an increment of 10, will result into the value 127, and further increments will always keep the value at 127. The same happens on underflows, but towards the value is blocked at the most negative value.\n- **FAIL**: in this mode no operation is performed on overflows or underflows detected. The corresponding return value is set to NULL to signal the condition to the caller.\n\nNote that each `OVERFLOW` statement only affects the `INCRBY` and `SET` commands that follow it in the list of subcommands, up to the next `OVERFLOW` statement.\n\nBy default, **WRAP** is used if not otherwise specified.\n\n    > BITFIELD mykey incrby u2 100 1 OVERFLOW SAT incrby u2 102 1\n    1) (integer) 1\n    2) (integer) 1\n    > BITFIELD mykey incrby u2 100 1 OVERFLOW SAT incrby u2 102 1\n    1) (integer) 2\n    2) (integer) 2\n    > BITFIELD mykey incrby u2 100 1 OVERFLOW SAT incrby u2 102 1\n    1) (integer) 3\n    2) (integer) 3\n    > BITFIELD mykey incrby u2 100 1 OVERFLOW SAT incrby u2 102 1\n    1) (integer) 0\n    2) (integer) 3\n\n## Return value\n\nThe command returns an array with each entry being the corresponding result of the sub command given at the same position. `OVERFLOW` subcommands don't count as generating a reply.\n\nThe following is an example of `OVERFLOW FAIL` returning NULL.\n\n    > BITFIELD mykey OVERFLOW FAIL incrby u2 102 1\n    1) (nil)\n\n## Motivations\n\nThe motivation for this command is that the ability to store many small integers as a single large bitmap (or segmented over a few keys to avoid having huge keys) is extremely memory efficient, and opens new use cases for Redis to be applied, especially in the field of real time analytics. This use cases are supported by the ability to specify the overflow in a controlled way.\n\nFun fact: Reddit's 2017 April fools' project [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place) was [built using the Redis BITFIELD command](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/13/how-we-built-rplace/) in order to take an in-memory representation of the collaborative canvas.\n\n## Performance considerations\n\nUsually `BITFIELD` is a fast command, however note that addressing far bits of currently short strings will trigger an allocation that may be more costly than executing the command on bits already existing.\n\n## Orders of bits\n\nThe representation used by `BITFIELD` considers the bitmap as having the bit number 0 to be the most significant bit of the first byte, and so forth, so for example setting a 5 bits unsigned integer to value 23 at offset 7 into a bitmap previously set to all zeroes, will produce the following representation:\n\n    +--------+--------+\n    |00000001|01110000|\n    +--------+--------+\n\nWhen offsets and integer sizes are aligned to bytes boundaries, this is the same as big endian, however when such alignment does not exist, its important to also understand how the bits inside a byte are ordered.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/bitfield/](https://redis.io/commands/bitfield/)"

  description: "# BITPOS\n\n    BITPOS\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nBITPOS key bit [start [end [BYTE | BIT]]]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.8.7\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@read`, `@bitmap`, `@slow`,\n\nReturn the position of the first bit set to 1 or 0 in a string.\n\nThe position is returned, thinking of the string as an array of bits from left to right, where the first byte's most significant bit is at position 0, the second byte's most significant bit is at position 8, and so forth.\n\nThe same bit position convention is followed by [`GETBIT`](../getbit) and [`SETBIT`](../setbit).\n\nBy default, all the bytes contained in the string are examined. It is possible to look for bits only in a specified interval passing the additional arguments *start* and *end* (it is possible to just pass *start*, the operation will assume that the end is the last byte of the string. However there are semantic differences as explained later). By default, the range is interpreted as a range of bytes and not a range of bits, so `start=0` and `end=2` means to look at the first three bytes.\n\nYou can use the optional `BIT` modifier to specify that the range should be interpreted as a range of bits. So `start=0` and `end=2` means to look at the first three bits.\n\nNote that bit positions are returned always as absolute values starting from bit zero even when *start* and *end* are used to specify a range.\n\nLike for the [`GETRANGE`](../getrange) command start and end can contain negative values in order to index bytes starting from the end of the string, where -1 is the last byte, -2 is the penultimate, and so forth.

So if the string is three bytes set to the value `0xff` the command `BITPOS key 0` will return 24, since up to bit 23 all the bits are 1.\n\nBasically, the function considers the right of the string as padded with zeros if you look for clear bits and specify no range or the *start* argument **only**.\n\nHowever, this behavior changes if you are looking for clear bits and specify a range with both **start** and **end**. If no clear bit is found in the specified range, the function returns -1 as the user specified a clear range and there are no 0 bits in that range.\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nSET mykey \"\\xff\\xf0\\x00\"\nBITPOS mykey 0\nSET mykey \"\\x00\\xff\\xf0\"\nBITPOS mykey 1 0\nBITPOS mykey 1 2\nBITPOS mykey 1 2 -1 BYTE\nBITPOS mykey 1 7 15 BIT\nset mykey \"\\x00\\x00\\x00\"\nBITPOS mykey 1\nBITPOS mykey 1 7 -3 BIT\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added the `BYTE|BIT` option.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/bitpos/](https://redis.io/commands/bitpos/)"

  summary: 'Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of provided keys'
  description: "# BLPOP\n\n    BLPOP\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nBLPOP key [key ...] timeout\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N) where N is the number of provided keys.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@list`, `@slow`, `@blocking`,\n\n`BLPOP` is a blocking list pop primitive. It is the blocking version of [`LPOP`](../lpop) because it blocks the connection when there are no elements to pop from any of the given lists. An element is popped from the head of the first list that is non-empty, with the given keys being checked in the order that they are given.\n\n## Non-blocking behavior\n\nWhen `BLPOP` is called, if at least one of the specified keys contains a non-empty list, an element is popped from the head of the list and returned to the caller together with the `key` it was popped from.\n\nKeys are checked in the order that they are given. Let's say that the key `list1` doesn't exist and `list2` and `list3` hold non-empty lists. Consider the following command:\n\n```\nBLPOP list1 list2 list3 0\n```\n\n`BLPOP` guarantees to return an element from the list stored at `list2` (since it is the first non empty list when checking `list1`, `list2` and `list3` in that order).\n\n## Blocking behavior\n\nIf none of the specified keys exist, `BLPOP` blocks the connection until another client performs an [`LPUSH`](../lpush) or [`RPUSH`](../rpush) operation against one of the keys.\n\nOnce new data is present on one of the lists, the client returns with the name of the key unblocking it and the popped value.\n\nWhen `BLPOP` causes a client to block and a non-zero timeout is specified, the client will unblock returning a `nil` multi-bulk value when the specified timeout has expired without a push operation against at least one of the specified keys.\n\n**The timeout argument is interpreted as a double value specifying the maximum number of seconds to block**. A timeout of zero can be used to block indefinitely.\n\n## What key is served first? What client? What element? Priority ordering details.\n\n- If the client tries to blocks for multiple keys, but at least one key contains elements, the returned key / element pair is the first key from left to right that has one or more elements. In this case the client is not blocked. So for instance `BLPOP key1 key2 key3 key4 0`, assuming that both `key2` and `key4` are non-empty, will always return an element from `key2`.\n- If multiple clients are blocked for the same key, the first client to be served is the one that was waiting for more time (the first that blocked for the key). Once a client is unblocked it does not retain any priority, when it blocks again with the next call to `BLPOP` it will be served accordingly to the number of clients already blocked for the same key, that will all be served before it (from the first to the last that blocked).\n- When a client is blocking for multiple keys at the same time, and elements are available at the same time in multiple keys (because of a transaction or a Lua script added elements to multiple lists), the client will be unblocked using the first key that received a push operation (assuming it has enough elements to serve our client, as there may be other clients as well waiting for this key). Basically after the execution of every command Redis will run a list of all the keys that received data AND that have at least a client blocked. The list is ordered by new element arrival time, from the first key that received data to the last. For every key processed, Redis will serve all the clients waiting for that key in a FIFO fashion, as long as there are elements in this key. When the key is empty or there are no longer clients waiting for this key, the next key that received new data in the previous command / transaction / script is processed, and so forth.\n\n## Behavior of `BLPOP` when multiple elements are pushed inside a list.\n\nThere are times when a list can receive multiple elements in the context of the same conceptual command:\n\n- Variadic push operations such as `LPUSH mylist a b c`.\n- After an [`EXEC`](../exec) of a [`MULTI`](../multi) block with multiple push operations against the same list.\n- Executing a Lua Script with Redis 2.6 or newer.\n\nWhen multiple elements are pushed inside a list where there are clients blocking, the behavior is different for Redis 2.4 and Redis 2.6 or newer.\n\nFor Redis 2.6 what happens is that the command performing multiple pushes is executed, and *only after* the execution of the command the blocked clients are served. Consider this sequence of commands.\n\n    Client A:   BLPOP foo 0\n    Client B:   LPUSH foo a b c\n\nIf the above condition happens using a Redis 2.6 server or greater, Client **A** will be served with the `c` element, because after the [`LPUSH`](../lpush) command the list contains `c,b,a`, so taking an element from the left means to return `c`.\n\nInstead Redis 2.4 works in a different way: clients are served *in the context* of the push operation, so as long as `LPUSH foo a b c` starts pushing the first element to the list, it will be delivered to the Client **A**, that will receive `a` (the first element pushed).\n\nThe behavior of Redis 2.4 creates a lot of problems when replicating or persisting data into the AOF file, so the much more generic and semantically simpler behavior was introduced into Redis 2.6 to prevent problems.\n\nNote that for the same reason a Lua script or a `MULTI/EXEC` block may push elements into a list and afterward **delete the list**. In this case the blocked clients will not be served at all and will continue to be blocked as long as no data is present on the list after the execution of a single command, transaction, or script.\n\n## `BLPOP` inside a `MULTI` / `EXEC` transaction\n\n`BLPOP` can be used with pipelining (sending multiple commands and reading the replies in batch), however this setup makes sense almost solely when it is the last command of the pipeline.\n\nUsing `BLPOP` inside a [`MULTI`](../multi) / [`EXEC`](../exec) block does not make a lot of sense as it would require blocking the entire server in order to execute the block atomically, which in turn does not allow other clients to perform a push operation. For this reason the behavior of `BLPOP` inside [`MULTI`](../multi) / [`EXEC`](../exec) when the list is empty is to return a `nil` multi-bulk reply, which is the same thing that happens when the timeout is reached.\n\nIf you like science fiction, think of time flowing at infinite speed inside a [`MULTI`](../multi) / [`EXEC`](../exec) block...\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): specifically:\n\n- A `nil` multi-bulk when no element could be popped and the timeout expired.\n- A two-element multi-bulk with the first element being the name of the key where an element was popped and the second element being the value of the popped element.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nredis> DEL list1 list2\n(integer) 0\nredis> RPUSH list1 a b c\n(integer) 3\nredis> BLPOP list1 list2 0\n1) \"list1\"\n2) \"a\"\n```\n\n## Reliable queues\n\nWhen `BLPOP` returns an element to the client, it also removes the element from the list. This means that the element only exists in the context of the client: if the client crashes while processing the returned element, it is lost forever.\n\nThis can be a problem with some application where we want a more reliable messaging system. When this is the case, please check the [`BRPOPLPUSH`](../brpoplpush) command, that is a variant of `BLPOP` that adds the returned element to a target list before returning it to the client.\n\n## Pattern: Event notification\n\nUsing blocking list operations it is possible to mount different blocking primitives. For instance for some application you may need to block waiting for elements into a Redis Set, so that as far as a new element is added to the Set, it is possible to retrieve it without resort to polling. This would require a blocking version of [`SPOP`](../spop) that is not available, but using blocking list operations we can easily accomplish this task.\n\nThe consumer will do:\n\n```\nLOOP forever\n    WHILE SPOP(key) returns elements\n        ... process elements ...\n    END\n    BRPOP helper_key\nEND\n```\n\nWhile in the producer side we'll use simply:\n\n```\nMULTI\nSADD key element\nLPUSH helper_key x\nEXEC\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.0.0: `timeout` is interpreted as a double instead of an integer.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/blpop/](https://redis.io/commands/blpop/)"

  summary: Create a Cuckoo Filter as key with a single sub-filter for the initial amount of capacity for items

Because of how Cuckoo Filters work, the filter is likely to declare itself full before `capacity` is reached and therefore fill rate will likely never reach 100%. The fill rate can be improved by using a larger `bucketsize` at the cost of a higher error rate. When the filter self-declare itself `full`, it will auto-expand by generating additional sub-filters at the cost of reduced performance and increased error rate. The new sub-filter is created with size of the previous sub-filter multiplied by `expansion`. Like bucket size, additional sub-filters grow the error rate linearly. The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `expansion`.\n\nThe minimal false positive error rate is 2/255 ≈ 0.78% when bucket size of 1 is used. Larger buckets increase the error rate linearly (for example, a bucket size of 3 yields a 2.35% error rate) but improve the fill rate of the filter.\n\n`maxiterations` dictates the number of attempts to find a slot for the incoming fingerprint. Once the filter gets full, high `maxIterations` value will slow down insertions.\n\nUnused capacity in prior sub-filters is automatically used when possible. The filter can grow up to 32 times.\n\n## Parameters:\n\n- **key**: The key under which the filter is found.\n- **capacity**: Estimated capacity for the filter. Capacity is rounded to the next `2^n` number. The filter will likely not fill up to 100% of it's capacity. Make sure to reserve extra capacity if you want to avoid expansions.\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n- **bucketsize**: Number of items in each bucket. A higher bucket size value improves the fill rate but also causes a higher error rate and slightly slower performance. The default value is 2.\n- **maxiterations**: Number of attempts to swap items between buckets before declaring filter as full and creating an additional filter. A low value is better for performance and a higher number is better for filter fill rate. The default value is 20.\n- **expansion**: When a new filter is created, its size is the size of the current filter multiplied by `expansion`. Expansion is rounded to the next `2^n` number. The default value is 1.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings) - `OK` if executed correctly, or [Error reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-errors) otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nredis> CF.RESERVE cf 1000\nOK\n```\n\n```\nredis> CF.RESERVE cf 1000\n(error) ERR item exists\n```\n\n```\nredis> CF.RESERVE cf_params 1000 BUCKETSIZE 8 MAXITERATIONS 20 EXPANSION 2\nOK\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/cf.reserve/](https://redis.io/commands/cf.reserve/)"

This command support two formats, the old format:\n\n    CLIENT KILL addr:port\n\nThe `ip:port` should match a line returned by the [`CLIENT LIST`](../client-list) command (`addr` field).\n\nThe new format:\n\n    CLIENT KILL <filter> <value> ... ... <filter> <value>\n\nWith the new form it is possible to kill clients by different attributes instead of killing just by address. The following filters are available:\n\n- `CLIENT KILL ADDR ip:port`. This is exactly the same as the old three-arguments behavior.\n- `CLIENT KILL LADDR ip:port`. Kill all clients connected to specified local (bind) address.\n- `CLIENT KILL ID client-id`. Allows to kill a client by its unique `ID` field. Client `ID`'s are retrieved using the [`CLIENT LIST`](../client-list) command.\n- `CLIENT KILL TYPE type`, where *type* is one of `normal`, `master`, `replica` and `pubsub`. This closes the connections of **all the clients** in the specified class. Note that clients blocked into the [`MONITOR`](../monitor) command are considered to belong to the `normal` class.\n- `CLIENT KILL USER username`. Closes all the connections that are authenticated with the specified [ACL](https://redis.io/topics/acl) username, however it returns an error if the username does not map to an existing ACL user.\n- `CLIENT KILL SKIPME yes/no`. By default this option is set to `yes`, that is, the client calling the command will not get killed, however setting this option to `no` will have the effect of also killing the client calling the command.\n\nIt is possible to provide multiple filters at the same time. The command will handle multiple filters via logical AND. For example:\n\n    CLIENT KILL addr 127.0.0.1:12345 type pubsub\n\nis valid and will kill only a pubsub client with the specified address. This format containing multiple filters is rarely useful currently.\n\nWhen the new form is used the command no longer returns `OK` or an error, but instead the number of killed clients, that may be zero.\n\n## CLIENT KILL and Redis Sentinel\n\nRecent versions of Redis Sentinel (Redis 2.8.12 or greater) use CLIENT KILL in order to kill clients when an instance is reconfigured, in order to force clients to perform the handshake with one Sentinel again and update its configuration.\n\n## Notes\n\nDue to the single-threaded nature of Redis, it is not possible to kill a client connection while it is executing a command. From the client point of view, the connection can never be closed in the middle of the execution of a command. However, the client will notice the connection has been closed only when the next command is sent (and results in network error).\n\n## Return\n\nWhen called with the three arguments format:\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if the connection exists and has been closed\n\nWhen called with the filter / value format:\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): the number of clients killed.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 2.8.12: Added new filter format.\n- Starting with Redis version 2.8.12: `ID` option.\n- Starting with Redis version 3.2.0: Added `master` type in for `TYPE` option.\n- Starting with Redis version 5.0.0: Replaced `slave` `TYPE` with `replica`. `slave` still supported for backward compatibility.\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: `LADDR` option.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/client-kill/](https://redis.io/commands/client-kill/)"

  summary: CLIENT PAUSE is a connections control command able to suspend all the Redis clients for the specified amount of time (in milliseconds)
  description: "# CLIENT\n\n    CLIENT PAUSE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nCLIENT PAUSE timeout [WRITE | ALL]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n3.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`, `@connection`,\n\n`CLIENT PAUSE` is a connections control command able to suspend all the Redis clients for the specified amount of time (in milliseconds).\n\nThe command performs the following actions:\n\n- It stops processing all the pending commands from normal and pub/sub clients for the given mode. However interactions with replicas will continue normally. Note that clients are formally paused when they try to execute a command, so no work is taken on the server side for inactive clients.\n- However it returns OK to the caller ASAP, so the `CLIENT PAUSE` command execution is not paused by itself.\n- When the specified amount of time has elapsed, all the clients are unblocked: this will trigger the processing of all the commands accumulated in the query buffer of every client during the pause.\n\nClient pause currently supports two modes:\n\n- `ALL`: This is the default mode. All client commands are blocked.\n- `WRITE`: Clients are only blocked if they attempt to execute a write command.\n\nFor the `WRITE` mode, some commands have special behavior:\n\n- [`EVAL`](../eval)/[`EVALSHA`](../evalsha): Will block client for all scripts.\n- [`PUBLISH`](../publish): Will block client.\n- [`PFCOUNT`](../pfcount): Will block client.\n- [`WAIT`](../wait): Acknowledgments will be delayed, so this command will appear blocked.\n\nThis command is useful as it makes able to switch clients from a Redis instance to another one in a controlled way. For example during an instance upgrade the system administrator could do the following:\n\n- Pause the clients using `CLIENT PAUSE`\n- Wait a few seconds to make sure the replicas processed the latest replication stream from the master.\n- Turn one of the replicas into a master.\n- Reconfigure clients to connect with the new master.\n\nSince Redis 6.2, the recommended mode for client pause is `WRITE`. This mode will stop all replication traffic, can be aborted with the [`CLIENT UNPAUSE`](../client-unpause) command, and allows reconfiguring the old master without risking accepting writes after the failover. This is also the mode used during cluster failover.\n\nFor versions before 6.2, it is possible to send `CLIENT PAUSE` in a MULTI/EXEC block together with the `INFO replication` command in order to get the current master offset at the time the clients are blocked. This way it is possible to wait for a specific offset in the replica side in order to make sure all the replication stream was processed.\n\nSince Redis 3.2.10 / 4.0.0, this command also prevents keys to be evicted or expired during the time clients are paused. This way the dataset is guaranteed to be static not just from the point of view of clients not being able to write, but also from the point of view of internal operations.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): The command returns OK or an error if the timeout is invalid.\n\n## Behavior change history\n\n- `>= 3.2.0`: Client pause prevents client pause and key eviction as well.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: `CLIENT PAUSE WRITE` mode added along with the `mode` option.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/client-pause/](https://redis.io/commands/client-pause/)"

For example when the client sends fire and forget commands or performs a mass loading of data, or in caching contexts where new data is streamed constantly. In such contexts to use server time and bandwidth in order to send back replies to clients, which are going to be ignored, is considered wasteful.\n\nThe `CLIENT REPLY` command controls whether the server will reply the client's commands. The following modes are available:\n\n- `ON`. This is the default mode in which the server returns a reply to every command.\n- `OFF`.

Some options may introduce additional complexity.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@slow`, `@connection`,\n\nThis command enables the tracking feature of the Redis server, that is used for [server assisted client side caching](https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching).\n\nWhen tracking is enabled Redis remembers the keys that the connection requested, in order to send later invalidation messages when such keys are modified. Invalidation messages are sent in the same connection (only available when the RESP3 protocol is used) or redirected in a different connection (available also with RESP2 and Pub/Sub). A special *broadcasting* mode is available where clients participating in this protocol receive every notification just subscribing to given key prefixes, regardless of the keys that they requested. Given the complexity of the argument please refer to [the main client side caching documentation](https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching) for the details. This manual page is only a reference for the options of this subcommand.\n\nIn order to enable tracking, use:\n\n    CLIENT TRACKING on ... options ...\n\nThe feature will remain active in the current connection for all its life, unless tracking is turned off with `CLIENT TRACKING off` at some point.\n\nThe following are the list of options that modify the behavior of the command when enabling tracking:\n\n- `REDIRECT <id>`: send invalidation messages to the connection with the specified ID. The connection must exist. You can get the ID of a connection using [`CLIENT ID`](../client-id). If the connection we are redirecting to is terminated, when in RESP3 mode the connection with tracking enabled will receive `tracking-redir-broken` push messages in order to signal the condition.\n- `BCAST`: enable tracking in broadcasting mode. In this mode invalidation messages are reported for all the prefixes specified, regardless of the keys requested by the connection. Instead when the broadcasting mode is not enabled, Redis will track which keys are fetched using read-only commands, and will report invalidation messages only for such keys.\n- `PREFIX <prefix>`: for broadcasting, register a given key prefix, so that notifications will be provided only for keys starting with this string. This option can be given multiple times to register multiple prefixes. If broadcasting is enabled without this option, Redis will send notifications for every key. You can't delete a single prefix, but you can delete all prefixes by disabling and re-enabling tracking. Using this option adds the additional time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the total number of prefixes tracked.\n- `OPTIN`: when broadcasting is NOT active, normally don't track keys in read only commands, unless they are called immediately after a `CLIENT CACHING yes` command.\n- `OPTOUT`: when broadcasting is NOT active, normally track keys in read only commands, unless they are called immediately after a `CLIENT CACHING no` command.\n- `NOLOOP`: don't send notifications about keys modified by this connection itself.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if the connection was successfully put in tracking mode or if the tracking mode was successfully disabled.

  description: "# CLIENT\n\n    CLIENT UNBLOCK\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nCLIENT UNBLOCK client-id [TIMEOUT | ERROR]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n5.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(log N) where N is the number of client connections\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`, `@connection`,\n\nThis command can unblock, from a different connection, a client blocked in a blocking operation, such as for instance [`BRPOP`](../brpop) or [`XREAD`](../xread) or [`WAIT`](../wait).\n\nBy default the client is unblocked as if the timeout of the command was reached, however if an additional (and optional) argument is passed, it is possible to specify the unblocking behavior, that can be **TIMEOUT** (the default) or **ERROR**. If **ERROR** is specified, the behavior is to unblock the client returning as error the fact that the client was force-unblocked. Specifically the client will receive the following error:\n\n    -UNBLOCKED client unblocked via CLIENT UNBLOCK\n\nNote: of course as usually it is not guaranteed that the error text remains the same, however the error code will remain `-UNBLOCKED`.\n\nThis command is useful especially when we are monitoring many keys with a limited number of connections. For instance we may want to monitor multiple streams with [`XREAD`](../xread) without using more than N connections. However at some point the consumer process is informed that there is one more stream key to monitor. In order to avoid using more connections, the best behavior would be to stop the blocking command from one of the connections in the pool, add the new key, and issue the blocking command again.\n\nTo obtain this behavior the following pattern is used. The process uses an additional *control connection* in order to send the `CLIENT UNBLOCK` command if needed. In the meantime, before running the blocking operation on the other connections, the process runs [`CLIENT ID`](../client-id) in order to get the ID associated with that connection. When a new key should be added, or when a key should no longer be monitored, the relevant connection blocking command is aborted by sending `CLIENT UNBLOCK` in the control connection. The blocking command will return and can be finally reissued.\n\nThis example shows the application in the context of Redis streams, however the pattern is a general one and can be applied to other cases.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nConnection A (blocking connection):\n> CLIENT ID\n2934\n> BRPOP key1 key2 key3 0\n(client is blocked)\n\n... Now we want to add a new key ...\n\nConnection B (control connection):\n> CLIENT UNBLOCK 2934\n1\n\nConnection A (blocking connection):\n... BRPOP reply with timeout ...\nNULL\n> BRPOP key1 key2 key3 key4 0\n(client is blocked again)\n```\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers), specifically:\n\n- `1` if the client was unblocked successfully.\n- `0` if the client wasn't unblocked.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/client-unblock/](https://redis.io/commands/client-unblock/)"

As a side effect of the command execution, if a slot among the ones specified as argument is set as `importing`, this state gets cleared once the node assigns the (previously unbound) slot to itself.\n\n## Example\n\nFor example the following command assigns slots 1 2 3 to the node receiving the command:\n\n    > CLUSTER ADDSLOTS 1 2 3\n    OK\n\nHowever trying to execute it again results into an error since the slots are already assigned:\n\n    > CLUSTER ADDSLOTS 1 2 3\n    ERR Slot 1 is already busy\n\n## Usage in Redis Cluster\n\nThis command only works in cluster mode and is useful in the following Redis Cluster operations:\n\n1.  To create a new cluster ADDSLOTS is used in order to initially setup master nodes splitting the available hash slots among them.\n2.  In order to fix a broken cluster where certain slots are unassigned.\n\n## Information about slots propagation and warnings\n\nNote that once a node assigns a set of slots to itself, it will start propagating this information in heartbeat packet headers. However the other nodes will accept the information only if they have the slot as not already bound with another node, or if the configuration epoch of the node advertising the new hash slot, is greater than the node currently listed in the table.\n\nThis means that this command should be used with care only by applications orchestrating Redis Cluster, like `redis-cli`, and the command if used out of the right context can leave the cluster in a wrong state or cause data loss.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if the command was successful.

  summary: This command, that can only be sent to a Redis Cluster replica node, forces the replica to start a manual failover of its master instance
  description: "# CLUSTER\n\n    CLUSTER FAILOVER\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nCLUSTER FAILOVER [FORCE | TAKEOVER]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n3.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\nThis command, that can only be sent to a Redis Cluster replica node, forces the replica to start a manual failover of its master instance.\n\nA manual failover is a special kind of failover that is usually executed when there are no actual failures, but we wish to swap the current master with one of its replicas (which is the node we send the command to), in a safe way, without any window for data loss. It works in the following way:\n\n1.  The replica tells the master to stop processing queries from clients.\n2.  The master replies to the replica with the current *replication offset*.\n3.  The replica waits for the replication offset to match on its side, to make sure it processed all the data from the master before it continues.\n4.  The replica starts a failover, obtains a new configuration epoch from the majority of the masters, and broadcasts the new configuration.\n5.  The old master receives the configuration update: unblocks its clients and starts replying with redirection messages so that they'll continue the chat with the new master.\n\nThis way clients are moved away from the old master to the new master atomically and only when the replica that is turning into the new master has processed all of the replication stream from the old master.\n\n## FORCE option: manual failover when the master is down\n\nThe command behavior can be modified by two options: **FORCE** and **TAKEOVER**.\n\nIf the **FORCE** option is given, the replica does not perform any handshake with the master, that may be not reachable, but instead just starts a failover ASAP starting from point 4. This is useful when we want to start a manual failover while the master is no longer reachable.\n\nHowever using **FORCE** we still need the majority of masters to be available in order to authorize the failover and generate a new configuration epoch for the replica that is going to become master.\n\n## TAKEOVER option: manual failover without cluster consensus\n\nThere are situations where this is not enough, and we want a replica to failover without any agreement with the rest of the cluster. A real world use case for this is to mass promote replicas in a different data center to masters in order to perform a data center switch, while all the masters are down or partitioned away.\n\nThe **TAKEOVER** option implies everything **FORCE** implies, but also does not uses any cluster authorization in order to failover. A replica receiving `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER` will instead:\n\n1.  Generate a new `configEpoch` unilaterally, just taking the current greatest epoch available and incrementing it if its local configuration epoch is not already the greatest.\n2.  Assign itself all the hash slots of its master, and propagate the new configuration to every node which is reachable ASAP, and eventually to every other node.\n\nNote that **TAKEOVER violates the last-failover-wins principle** of Redis Cluster, since the configuration epoch generated by the replica violates the normal generation of configuration epochs in several ways:\n\n1.  There is no guarantee that it is actually the higher configuration epoch, since, for example, we can use the **TAKEOVER** option within a minority, nor any message exchange is performed to generate the new configuration epoch.\n2.  If we generate a configuration epoch which happens to collide with another instance, eventually our configuration epoch, or the one of another instance with our same epoch, will be moved away using the *configuration epoch collision resolution algorithm*.\n\nBecause of this the **TAKEOVER** option should be used with care.\n\n## Implementation details and notes\n\n- `CLUSTER FAILOVER`, unless the **TAKEOVER** option is specified, does not execute a failover synchronously. It only *schedules* a manual failover, bypassing the failure detection stage.\n- An `OK` reply is no guarantee that the failover will succeed.\n- A replica can only be promoted to a master if it is known as a replica by a majority of the masters in the cluster. If the replica is a new node that has just been added to the cluster (for example after upgrading it), it may not yet be known to all the masters in the cluster. To check that the masters are aware of a new replica, you can send [`CLUSTER NODES`](../cluster-nodes) or [`CLUSTER REPLICAS`](../cluster-replicas) to each of the master nodes and check that it appears as a replica, before sending `CLUSTER FAILOVER` to the replica.\n- To check that the failover has actually happened you can use [`ROLE`](../role), `INFO REPLICATION` (which indicates \"role:master\" after successful failover), or [`CLUSTER NODES`](../cluster-nodes) to verify that the state of the cluster has changed sometime after the command was sent.\n- To check if the failover has failed, check the replica's log for \"Manual failover timed out\", which is logged if the replica has given up after a few seconds.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if the command was accepted and a manual failover is going to be attempted.

In other words the specified node is removed from the *nodes table* of the node receiving the command.\n\nBecause when a given node is part of the cluster, all the other nodes participating in the cluster knows about it, in order for a node to be completely removed from a cluster, the `CLUSTER FORGET` command must be sent to all the remaining nodes, regardless of the fact they are masters or replicas.\n\nHowever the command cannot simply drop the node from the internal node table of the node receiving the command, it also implements a ban-list, not allowing the same node to be added again as a side effect of processing the *gossip section* of the heartbeat packets received from other nodes.\n\n## Details on why the ban-list is needed\n\nIn the following example we'll show why the command must not just remove a given node from the nodes table, but also prevent it for being re-inserted again for some time.\n\nLet's assume we have four nodes, A, B, C and D. In order to end with just a three nodes cluster A, B, C we may follow these steps:\n\n1.  Reshard all the hash slots from D to nodes A, B, C.\n2.  D is now empty, but still listed in the nodes table of A, B and C.\n3.  We contact A, and send `CLUSTER FORGET D`.\n4.  B sends node A a heartbeat packet, where node D is listed.\n5.  A does no longer known node D (see step 3), so it starts a handshake with D.\n6.  D ends re-added in the nodes table of A.\n\nAs you can see in this way removing a node is fragile, we need to send `CLUSTER FORGET` commands to all the nodes ASAP hoping there are no gossip sections processing in the meantime. Because of this problem the command implements a ban-list with an expire time for each entry.\n\nSo what the command really does is:\n\n1.  The specified node gets removed from the nodes table.\n2.  The node ID of the removed node gets added to the ban-list, for 1 minute.\n3.  The node will skip all the node IDs listed in the ban-list when processing gossip sections received in heartbeat packets from other nodes.\n\nThis way we have a 60 second window to inform all the nodes in the cluster that we want to remove a node.\n\n## Special conditions not allowing the command execution\n\nThe command does not succeed and returns an error in the following cases:\n\n1.  The specified node ID is not found in the nodes table.\n2.  The node receiving the command is a replica, and the specified node ID identifies its current master.\n3.  The node ID identifies the same node we are sending the command to.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if the command was executed successfully, otherwise an error is returned.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/cluster-forget/](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-forget/)"

  summary: CLUSTER MEET is used in order to connect different Redis nodes with cluster support enabled, into a working cluster
  description: "# CLUSTER\n\n    CLUSTER MEET\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nCLUSTER MEET ip port [cluster-bus-port]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n3.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\n`CLUSTER MEET` is used in order to connect different Redis nodes with cluster support enabled, into a working cluster.\n\nThe basic idea is that nodes by default don't trust each other, and are considered unknown, so that it is unlikely that different cluster nodes will mix into a single one because of system administration errors or network addresses modifications.\n\nSo in order for a given node to accept another one into the list of nodes composing a Redis Cluster, there are only two ways:\n\n1.  The system administrator sends a `CLUSTER MEET` command to force a node to meet another one.\n2.  An already known node sends a list of nodes in the gossip section that we are not aware of. If the receiving node trusts the sending node as a known node, it will process the gossip section and send a handshake to the nodes that are still not known.\n\nNote that Redis Cluster needs to form a full mesh (each node is connected with each other node), but in order to create a cluster, there is no need to send all the `CLUSTER MEET` commands needed to form the full mesh. What matter is to send enough `CLUSTER MEET` messages so that each node can reach each other node through a *chain of known nodes*. Thanks to the exchange of gossip information in heartbeat packets, the missing links will be created.\n\nSo, if we link node A with node B via `CLUSTER MEET`, and B with C, A and C will find their ways to handshake and create a link.\n\nAnother example: if we imagine a cluster formed of the following four nodes called A, B, C and D, we may send just the following set of commands to A:\n\n1.  `CLUSTER MEET B-ip B-port`\n2.  `CLUSTER MEET C-ip C-port`\n3.  `CLUSTER MEET D-ip D-port`\n\nAs a side effect of `A` knowing and being known by all the other nodes, it will send gossip sections in the heartbeat packets that will allow each other node to create a link with each other one, forming a full mesh in a matter of seconds, even if the cluster is large.\n\nMoreover `CLUSTER MEET` does not need to be reciprocal. If I send the command to A in order to join B, I don't need to also send it to B in order to join A.\n\nIf the optional `cluster_bus_port` argument is not provided, the default of port + 10000 will be used.\n\n## Implementation details: MEET and PING packets\n\nWhen a given node receives a `CLUSTER MEET` message, the node specified in the command still does not know the node we sent the command to. So in order for the node to force the receiver to accept it as a trusted node, it sends a `MEET` packet instead of a [`PING`](../ping) packet. The two packets have exactly the same format, but the former forces the receiver to acknowledge the node as trusted.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if the command was successful. If the address or port specified are invalid an error is returned.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 4.0.0: Added the optional `cluster_bus_port` argument.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/cluster-meet/](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-meet/)"

It is also used by `redis-cli` in order to manage a cluster.\n\n## Serialization format\n\nThe output of the command is just a space-separated CSV string, where each line represents a node in the cluster. Starting from 7.2.0, the output of the command always contains a new auxiliary field called shard-id. The following is an example of output on Redis 7.2.0.\n\n```\n07c37dfeb235213a872192d90877d0cd55635b91 127.0.0.1:30004@31004,,shard-id=69bc080733d1355567173199cff4a6a039a2f024 slave e7d1eecce10fd6bb5eb35b9f99a514335d9ba9ca 0 1426238317239 4 connected\n67ed2db8d677e59ec4a4cefb06858cf2a1a89fa1 127.0.0.1:30002@31002,,shard-id=114f6674a35b84949fe567f5dfd41415ee776261 master - 0 1426238316232 2 connected 5461-10922\n292f8b365bb7edb5e285caf0b7e6ddc7265d2f4f 127.0.0.1:30003@31003,,shard-id=fdb36c73e72dd027bc19811b7c219ef6e55c550e master - 0 1426238318243 3 connected 10923-16383\n6ec23923021cf3ffec47632106199cb7f496ce01 127.0.0.1:30005@31005,,shard-id=114f6674a35b84949fe567f5dfd41415ee776261 slave 67ed2db8d677e59ec4a4cefb06858cf2a1a89fa1 0 1426238316232 5 connected\n824fe116063bc5fcf9f4ffd895bc17aee7731ac3 127.0.0.1:30006@31006,,shard-id=fdb36c73e72dd027bc19811b7c219ef6e55c550e slave 292f8b365bb7edb5e285caf0b7e6ddc7265d2f4f 0 1426238317741 6 connected\ne7d1eecce10fd6bb5eb35b9f99a514335d9ba9ca 127.0.0.1:30001@31001,,shard-id=69bc080733d1355567173199cff4a6a039a2f024 myself,master - 0 0 1 connected 0-5460\n```\n\nEach line is composed of the following fields:\n\n```\n<id> <ip:port@cport[,hostname[,auxiliary_field=value]*]> <flags> <master> <ping-sent> <pong-recv> <config-epoch> <link-state> <slot> <slot> ... <slot>\n```\n\nThe meaning of each filed is the following:\n\n1.  `id`: The node ID, a 40-character globally unique string generated when a node is created and never changed again (unless `CLUSTER RESET HARD` is used).\n2.  `ip:port@cport`: The node address that clients should contact to run queries.\n3.  `hostname`: A human readable string that can be configured via the `cluster-annouce-hostname` setting. The max length of the string is 256 characters, excluding the null terminator. The name can contain ASCII alphanumeric characters, '-', and '.' only.\n4.  `[,auxiliary_field=value]*`: A list of comma-separated key-value pairs that represent various node properties, such as `shard-id`. There is no intrinsic order among auxiliary fields. The auxiliary fields can appear at different position in the list from release to release. Both the key name and value can contain ASCII alphanumeric characters and the characters in `!#$%&()*+-.:;<>?@[]^_{|}~` only. Auxiliary fields are explained in detail in the section below.\n5.  `flags`: A list of comma separated flags: `myself`, `master`, `slave`, `fail?`, `fail`, `handshake`, `noaddr`, `nofailover`, `noflags`. Flags are explained below.\n6.  `master`: If the node is a replica, and the primary is known, the primary node ID, otherwise the \"-\" character.\n7.  `ping-sent`: Unix time at which the currently active ping was sent, or zero if there are no pending pings, in milliseconds.\n8.  `pong-recv`: Unix time the last pong was received, in milliseconds.\n9.  `config-epoch`: The configuration epoch (or version) of the current node (or of the current primary if the node is a replica). Each time there is a failover, a new, unique, monotonically increasing configuration epoch is created. If multiple nodes claim to serve the same hash slots, the one with the higher configuration epoch wins.\n10. `link-state`: The state of the link used for the node-to-node cluster bus. Use this link to communicate with the node. Can be `connected` or `disconnected`.\n11. `slot`: A hash slot number or range. Starting from argument number 9, but there may be up to 16384 entries in total (limit never reached). This is the list of hash slots served by this node. If the entry is just a number, it is parsed as such. If it is a range, it is in the form `start-end`, and means that the node is responsible for all the hash slots from `start` to `end` including the start and end values.\n\nAuxiliary fields are:\n\n- `shard-id`: a 40-character globally unique string generated when a node is created. A node's shard id changes only when the node joins a different shard via `cluster replicate` and there the node's shard id is updated to its primary's.\n\nFlags are:\n\n- `myself`: The node you are contacting.\n- `master`: Node is a primary.\n- `slave`: Node is a replica.\n- `fail?`: Node is in `PFAIL` state. Not reachable for the node you are contacting, but still logically reachable (not in `FAIL` state).\n- `fail`: Node is in `FAIL` state. It was not reachable for multiple nodes that promoted the `PFAIL` state to `FAIL`.\n- `handshake`: Untrusted node, we are handshaking.\n- `noaddr`: No address known for this node.\n- `nofailover`: Replica will not try to failover.\n- `noflags`: No flags at all.\n\n## Notes on published config epochs\n\nReplicas broadcast their primary's config epochs (in order to get an `UPDATE` message if they are found to be stale), so the real config epoch of the replica (which is meaningless more or less, since they don't serve hash slots) can be only obtained checking the node flagged as `myself`, which is the entry of the node we are asking to generate `CLUSTER NODES` output. The other replicas epochs reflect what they publish in heartbeat packets, which is, the configuration epoch of the primaries they are currently replicating.\n\n## Special slot entries\n\nNormally hash slots associated to a given node are in one of the following formats, as already explained above:\n\n1.  Single number: 3894\n2.  Range: 3900-4000\n\nHowever node hash slots can be in a special state, used in order to communicate errors after a node restart (mismatch between the keys in the AOF/RDB file, and the node hash slots configuration), or when there is a resharding operation in progress. This two states are **importing** and **migrating**.\n\nThe meaning of the two states is explained in the Redis Specification, however the gist of the two states is the following:\n\n- **Importing** slots are yet not part of the nodes hash slot, there is a migration in progress. The node will accept queries about these slots only if the `ASK` command is used.\n- **Migrating** slots are assigned to the node, but are being migrated to some other node. The node will accept queries if all the keys in the command exist already, otherwise it will emit what is called an **ASK redirection**, to force new keys creation directly in the importing node.\n\nImporting and migrating slots are emitted in the `CLUSTER NODES` output as follows:\n\n- **Importing slot:** `[slot_number-<-importing_from_node_id]`\n- **Migrating slot:** `[slot_number->-migrating_to_node_id]`\n\nThe following are a few examples of importing and migrating slots:\n\n- `[93-<-292f8b365bb7edb5e285caf0b7e6ddc7265d2f4f]`\n- `[1002-<-67ed2db8d677e59ec4a4cefb06858cf2a1a89fa1]`\n- `[77->-e7d1eecce10fd6bb5eb35b9f99a514335d9ba9ca]`\n- `[16311->-292f8b365bb7edb5e285caf0b7e6ddc7265d2f4f]`\n\nNote that the format does not have any space, so `CLUSTER NODES` output format is plain CSV with space as separator even when this special slots are emitted. However a complete parser for the format should be able to handle them.\n\nNote that:\n\n1.  Migration and importing slots are only added to the node flagged as `myself`. This information is local to a node, for its own slots.\n2.  Importing and migrating slots are provided as **additional info**. If the node has a given hash slot assigned, it will be also a plain number in the list of hash slots, so clients that don't have a clue about hash slots migrations can just skip this special fields.\n\n## Return\n\n[Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings): The serialized cluster configuration.\n\n**A note about the word slave used in this man page and command name**: Starting with Redis 5, if not for backward compatibility, the Redis project no longer uses the word slave.

  summary: CLUSTER SETSLOT is responsible of changing the state of a hash slot in the receiving node in different ways
  description: "# CLUSTER\n\n    CLUSTER SETSLOT\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nCLUSTER SETSLOT slot <IMPORTING node-id | MIGRATING node-id |\n  NODE node-id | STABLE>\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n3.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\n`CLUSTER SETSLOT` is responsible of changing the state of a hash slot in the receiving node in different ways. It can, depending on the subcommand used:\n\n1.  `MIGRATING` subcommand: Set a hash slot in *migrating* state.\n2.  `IMPORTING` subcommand: Set a hash slot in *importing* state.\n3.  `STABLE` subcommand: Clear any importing / migrating state from hash slot.\n4.  `NODE` subcommand: Bind the hash slot to a different node.\n\nThe command with its set of subcommands is useful in order to start and end cluster live resharding operations, which are accomplished by setting a hash slot in migrating state in the source node, and importing state in the destination node.\n\nEach subcommand is documented below. At the end you'll find a description of how live resharding is performed using this command and other related commands.\n\n## CLUSTER SETSLOT `<slot>` MIGRATING `<destination-node-id>`\n\nThis subcommand sets a slot to *migrating* state. In order to set a slot in this state, the node receiving the command must be the hash slot owner, otherwise an error is returned.\n\nWhen a slot is set in migrating state, the node changes behavior in the following way:\n\n1.  If a command is received about an existing key, the command is processed as usually.\n2.  If a command is received about a key that does not exists, an `ASK` redirection is emitted by the node, asking the client to retry only that specific query into `destination-node`. In this case the client should not update its hash slot to node mapping.\n3.  If the command contains multiple keys, in case none exist, the behavior is the same as point 2, if all exist, it is the same as point 1, however if only a partial number of keys exist, the command emits a `TRYAGAIN` error in order for the keys interested to finish being migrated to the target node, so that the multi keys command can be executed.\n\n## CLUSTER SETSLOT `<slot>` IMPORTING `<source-node-id>`\n\nThis subcommand is the reverse of `MIGRATING`, and prepares the destination node to import keys from the specified source node. The command only works if the node is not already owner of the specified hash slot.\n\nWhen a slot is set in importing state, the node changes behavior in the following way:\n\n1.  Commands about this hash slot are refused and a `MOVED` redirection is generated as usually, but in the case the command follows an [`ASKING`](../asking) command, in this case the command is executed.\n\nIn this way when a node in migrating state generates an `ASK` redirection, the client contacts the target node, sends [`ASKING`](../asking), and immediately after sends the command. This way commands about non-existing keys in the old node or keys already migrated to the target node are executed in the target node, so that:\n\n1.  New keys are always created in the target node. During a hash slot migration we'll have to move only old keys, not new ones.\n2.  Commands about keys already migrated are correctly processed in the context of the node which is the target of the migration, the new hash slot owner, in order to guarantee consistency.\n3.  Without [`ASKING`](../asking) the behavior is the same as usually. This guarantees that clients with a broken hash slots mapping will not write for error in the target node, creating a new version of a key that has yet to be migrated.\n\n## CLUSTER SETSLOT `<slot>` STABLE\n\nThis subcommand just clears migrating / importing state from the slot. It is mainly used to fix a cluster stuck in a wrong state by `redis-cli --cluster fix`. Normally the two states are cleared automatically at the end of the migration using the `SETSLOT ... NODE ...` subcommand as explained in the next section.\n\n## CLUSTER SETSLOT `<slot>` NODE `<node-id>`\n\nThe `NODE` subcommand is the one with the most complex semantics. It associates the hash slot with the specified node, however the command works only in specific situations and has different side effects depending on the slot state. The following is the set of pre-conditions and side effects of the command:\n\n1.  If the current hash slot owner is the node receiving the command, but for effect of the command the slot would be assigned to a different node, the command will return an error if there are still keys for that hash slot in the node receiving the command.\n2.  If the slot is in *migrating* state, the state gets cleared when the slot is assigned to another node.\n3.  If the slot was in *importing* state in the node receiving the command, and the command assigns the slot to this node (which happens in the target node at the end of the resharding of a hash slot from one node to another), the command has the following side effects: A) the *importing* state is cleared. B) If the node config epoch is not already the greatest of the cluster, it generates a new one and assigns the new config epoch to itself. This way its new hash slot ownership will win over any past configuration created by previous failovers or slot migrations.\n\nIt is important to note that step 3 is the only time when a Redis Cluster node will create a new config epoch without agreement from other nodes. This only happens when a manual configuration is operated. However it is impossible that this creates a non-transient setup where two nodes have the same config epoch, since Redis Cluster uses a config epoch collision resolution algorithm.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): All the subcommands return `OK` if the command was successful. Otherwise an error is returned.\n\n## Redis Cluster live resharding explained\n\nThe `CLUSTER SETSLOT` command is an important piece used by Redis Cluster in order to migrate all the keys contained in one hash slot from one node to another. This is how the migration is orchestrated, with the help of other commands as well. We'll call the node that has the current ownership of the hash slot the `source` node, and the node where we want to migrate the `destination` node.\n\n1.  Set the destination node slot to *importing* state using `CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> IMPORTING <source-node-id>`.\n2.  Set the source node slot to *migrating* state using `CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> MIGRATING <destination-node-id>`.\n3.  Get keys from the source node with [`CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT`](../cluster-getkeysinslot) command and move them into the destination node using the [`MIGRATE`](../migrate) command.\n4.  Send `CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> NODE <destination-node-id>` to the destination node.\n5.  Send `CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> NODE <destination-node-id>` to the source node.\n6.  Send `CLUSTER SETSLOT <slot> NODE <destination-node-id>` to the other master nodes (optional).\n\nNotes:\n\n- The order of step 1 and 2 is important. We want the destination node to be ready to accept `ASK` redirections when the source node is configured to redirect.\n- The order of step 4 and 5 is important. The destination node is responsible for propagating the change to the rest of the cluster. If the source node is informed before the destination node and the destination node crashes before it is set as new slot owner, the slot is left with no owner, even after a successful failover.\n- Step 6, sending `SETSLOT` to the nodes not involved in the resharding, is not technically necessary since the configuration will eventually propagate itself. However, it is a good idea to do so in order to stop nodes from pointing to the wrong node for the hash slot moved as soon as possible, resulting in less redirections to find the right node.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/cluster-setslot/](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-setslot/)"

  summary: CLUSTER SHARDS returns details about the shards of the cluster
  description: "# CLUSTER\n\n    CLUSTER SHARDS\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nCLUSTER SHARDS\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n7.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N) where N is the total number of cluster nodes\n\nACL categories:  \n`@slow`,\n\n`CLUSTER SHARDS` returns details about the shards of the cluster. A shard is defined as a collection of nodes that serve the same set of slots and that replicate from each other. A shard may only have a single master at a given time, but may have multiple or no replicas. It is possible for a shard to not be serving any slots while still having replicas.\n\nThis command replaces the [`CLUSTER SLOTS`](../cluster-slots) command, by providing a more efficient and extensible representation of the cluster.\n\nThe command is suitable to be used by Redis Cluster client libraries in order to understand the topology of the cluster. A client should issue this command on startup in order to retrieve the map associating cluster *hash slots* with actual node information. This map should be used to direct commands to the node that is likely serving the slot associated with a given command. In the event the command is sent to the wrong node, in that it received a '-MOVED' redirect, this command can then be used to update the topology of the cluster.\n\nThe command returns an array of shards, with each shard containing two fields, 'slots' and 'nodes'.\n\nThe 'slots' field is a list of slot ranges served by this shard, stored as pair of integers representing the inclusive start and end slots of the ranges. For example, if a node owns the slots 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9, the slots ranges would be stored as \\[1-3\\], \\[5-5\\], \\[7-9\\]. The slots field would therefore be represented by the following list of integers.\n\n```\n1) 1) \"slots\"\n   2) 1) (integer) 1\n      2) (integer) 3\n      3) (integer) 5\n      4) (integer) 5\n      5) (integer) 7\n      6) (integer) 9\n```\n\nThe 'nodes' field contains a list of all nodes within the shard. Each individual node is a map of attributes that describe the node. Some attributes are optional and more attributes may be added in the future. The current list of attributes:\n\n- id: The unique node id for this particular node.\n- endpoint: The preferred endpoint to reach the node, see below for more information about the possible values of this field.\n- ip: The IP address to send requests to for this node.\n- hostname (optional): The announced hostname to send requests to for this node.\n- port (optional): The TCP (non-TLS) port of the node. At least one of port or tls-port will be present.\n- tls-port (optional): The TLS port of the node. At least one of port or tls-port will be present.\n- role: The replication role of this node.\n- replication-offset: The replication offset of this node. This information can be used to send commands to the most up to date replicas.\n- health: Either `online`, `failed`, or `loading`. This information should be used to determine which nodes should be sent traffic. The `loading` health state should be used to know that a node is not currently eligible to serve traffic, but may be eligible in the future.\n\nThe endpoint, along with the port, defines the location that clients should use to send requests for a given slot. A NULL value for the endpoint indicates the node has an unknown endpoint and the client should connect to the same endpoint it used to send the `CLUSTER SHARDS` command but with the port returned from the command. This unknown endpoint configuration is useful when the Redis nodes are behind a load balancer that Redis doesn't know the endpoint of. Which endpoint is set is determined by the `cluster-preferred-endpoint-type` config.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): nested list of a map of hash ranges and shard nodes.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n> CLUSTER SHARDS\n1) 1) \"slots\"\n   2) 1) (integer) 0\n      2) (integer) 5460\n   3) \"nodes\"\n   4) 1)  1) \"id\"\n          2) \"e10b7051d6bf2d5febd39a2be297bbaea6084111\"\n          3) \"port\"\n          4) (integer) 30001\n          5) \"ip\"\n          6) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          7) \"endpoint\"\n          8) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          9) \"role\"\n         10) \"master\"\n         11) \"replication-offset\"\n         12) (integer) 72156\n         13) \"health\"\n         14) \"online\"\n      2)  1) \"id\"\n          2) \"1901f5962d865341e81c85f9f596b1e7160c35ce\"\n          3) \"port\"\n          4) (integer) 30006\n          5) \"ip\"\n          6) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          7) \"endpoint\"\n          8) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          9) \"role\"\n         10) \"replica\"\n         11) \"replication-offset\"\n         12) (integer) 72156\n         13) \"health\"\n         14) \"online\"\n2) 1) \"slots\"\n   2) 1) (integer) 10923\n      2) (integer) 16383\n   3) \"nodes\"\n   4) 1)  1) \"id\"\n          2) \"fd20502fe1b32fc32c15b69b0a9537551f162f1f\"\n          3) \"port\"\n          4) (integer) 30003\n          5) \"ip\"\n          6) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          7) \"endpoint\"\n          8) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          9) \"role\"\n         10) \"master\"\n         11) \"replication-offset\"\n         12) (integer) 72156\n         13) \"health\"\n         14) \"online\"\n      2)  1) \"id\"\n          2) \"6daa25c08025a0c7e4cc0d1ab255949ce6cee902\"\n          3) \"port\"\n          4) (integer) 30005\n          5) \"ip\"\n          6) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          7) \"endpoint\"\n          8) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          9) \"role\"\n         10) \"replica\"\n         11) \"replication-offset\"\n         12) (integer) 72156\n         13) \"health\"\n         14) \"online\"\n3) 1) \"slots\"\n   2) 1) (integer) 5461\n      2) (integer) 10922\n   3) \"nodes\"\n   4) 1)  1) \"id\"\n          2) \"a4a3f445ead085eb3eb9ee7d8c644ec4481ec9be\"\n          3) \"port\"\n          4) (integer) 30002\n          5) \"ip\"\n          6) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          7) \"endpoint\"\n          8) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          9) \"role\"\n         10) \"master\"\n         11) \"replication-offset\"\n         12) (integer) 72156\n         13) \"health\"\n         14) \"online\"\n      2)  1) \"id\"\n          2) \"da6d5847aa019e9b9d2a8aa24a75f856fd3456cc\"\n          3) \"port\"\n          4) (integer) 30004\n          5) \"ip\"\n          6) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          7) \"endpoint\"\n          8) \"127.0.0.1\"\n          9) \"role\"\n         10) \"replica\"\n         11) \"replication-offset\"\n         12) (integer) 72156\n         13) \"health\"\n         14) \"online\"\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/cluster-shards/](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-shards/)"

All networking information after the third nested reply are replicas of the master.\n\nIf a cluster instance has non-contiguous slots (e.g. 1-400,900,1800-6000) then master and replica networking information results will be duplicated for each top-level slot range reply.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): nested list of slot ranges with networking information.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n> CLUSTER SLOTS\n1) 1) (integer) 0\n   2) (integer) 5460\n   3) 1) \"127.0.0.1\"\n      2) (integer) 30001\n      3) \"09dbe9720cda62f7865eabc5fd8857c5d2678366\"\n      4) 1) hostname\n         2) \"host-1.redis.example.com\"\n   4) 1) \"127.0.0.1\"\n      2) (integer) 30004\n      3) \"821d8ca00d7ccf931ed3ffc7e3db0599d2271abf\"\n      4) 1) hostname\n         2) \"host-2.redis.example.com\"\n2) 1) (integer) 5461\n   2) (integer) 10922\n   3) 1) \"127.0.0.1\"\n      2) (integer) 30002\n      3) \"c9d93d9f2c0c524ff34cc11838c2003d8c29e013\"\n      4) 1) hostname\n         2) \"host-3.redis.example.com\"\n   4) 1) \"127.0.0.1\"\n      2) (integer) 30005\n      3) \"faadb3eb99009de4ab72ad6b6ed87634c7ee410f\"\n      4) 1) hostname\n         2) \"host-4.redis.example.com\"\n3) 1) (integer) 10923\n   2) (integer) 16383\n   3) 1) \"127.0.0.1\"\n      2) (integer) 30003\n      3) \"044ec91f325b7595e76dbcb18cc688b6a5b434a1\"\n      4) 1) hostname\n         2) \"host-5.redis.example.com\"\n   4) 1) \"127.0.0.1\"\n      2) (integer) 30006\n      3) \"58e6e48d41228013e5d9c1c37c5060693925e97e\"\n      4) 1) hostname\n         2) \"host-6.redis.example.com\"\n```\n\n**Warning:** In future versions there could be more elements describing the node better. In general a client implementation should just rely on the fact that certain parameters are at fixed positions as specified, but more parameters may follow and should be ignored. Similarly a client library should try if possible to cope with the fact that older versions may just have the primary endpoint and port parameter.\n\n## Behavior change history\n\n- `>= 7.0.0`: Added support for hostnames and unknown endpoints in first field of node response.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 4.0.0: Added node IDs.\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added additional networking metadata field.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/cluster-slots/](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-slots/)"

  summary: Return an array with details about every Redis command
  description: "# COMMAND\n\n    COMMAND\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nCOMMAND\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.8.13\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N) where N is the total number of Redis commands\n\nACL categories:  \n`@slow`, `@connection`,\n\nReturn an array with details about every Redis command.\n\nThe `COMMAND` command is introspective. Its reply describes all commands that the server can process. Redis clients can call it to obtain the server's runtime capabilities during the handshake.\n\n`COMMAND` also has several subcommands. Please refer to its subcommands for further details.\n\n**Cluster note:** this command is especially beneficial for cluster-aware clients. Such clients must identify the names of keys in commands to route requests to the correct shard. Although most commands accept a single key as their first argument, there are many exceptions to this rule. You can call `COMMAND` and then keep the mapping between commands and their respective key specification rules cached in the client.\n\nThe reply it returns is an array with an element per command. Each element that describes a Redis command is represented as an array by itself.\n\nThe command's array consists of a fixed number of elements. The exact number of elements in the array depends on the server's version.\n\n1.  Name\n2.  Arity\n3.  Flags\n4.  First key\n5.  Last key\n6.  Step\n7.  [ACL categories](https://redis.io/topics/acl) (as of Redis 6.0)\n8.  [Tips](https://redis.io/topics/command-tips) (as of Redis 7.0)\n9.  [Key specifications](https://redis.io/topics/key-specs) (as of Redis 7.0)\n10. Subcommands (as of Redis 7.0)\n\n## Name\n\nThis is the command's name in lowercase.\n\n**Note:** Redis command names are case-insensitive.\n\n## Arity\n\nArity is the number of arguments a command expects. It follows a simple pattern:\n\n- A positive integer means a fixed number of arguments.\n- A negative integer means a minimal number of arguments.\n\nCommand arity *always includes* the command's name itself (and the subcommand when applicable).\n\nExamples:\n\n- [`GET`](../get)'s arity is *2* since the command only accepts one argument and always has the format `GET _key_`.\n- [`MGET`](../mget)'s arity is *-2* since the command accepts at least one argument, but possibly multiple ones: `MGET _key1_ [key2] [key3] ...`.\n\n## Flags\n\nCommand flags are an array. It can contain the following simple strings (status reply):\n\n- **admin:** the command is an administrative command.\n- **asking:** the command is allowed even during hash slot migration. This flag is relevant in Redis Cluster deployments.\n- **blocking:** the command may block the requesting client.\n- **denyoom**: the command is rejected if the server's memory usage is too high (see the *maxmemory* configuration directive).\n- **fast:** the command operates in constant or log(N) time. This flag is used for monitoring latency with the [`LATENCY`](../latency) command.\n- **loading:** the command is allowed while the database is loading.\n- **movablekeys:** the *first key*, *last key*, and *step* values don't determine all key positions. Clients need to use [`COMMAND GETKEYS`](../command-getkeys) or [key specifications](https://redis.io/topics/key-specs) in this case. See below for more details.\n- **no_auth:** executing the command doesn't require authentication.\n- **no_async_loading:** the command is denied during asynchronous loading (that is when a replica uses disk-less `SWAPDB SYNC`, and allows access to the old dataset).\n- **no_mandatory_keys:** the command may accept key name arguments, but these aren't mandatory.\n- **no_multi:** the command isn't allowed inside the context of a [transaction](https://redis.io/topics/transactions).\n- **noscript:** the command can't be called from [scripts](https://redis.io/topics/eval-intro) or [functions](https://redis.io/topics/functions-intro).\n- **pubsub:** the command is related to [Redis Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub).\n- **random**: the command returns random results, which is a concern with verbatim script replication. As of Redis 7.0, this flag is a [command tip](https://redis.io/topics/command-tips).\n- **readonly:** the command doesn't modify data.\n- **sort_for_script:** the command's output is sorted when called from a script.\n- **skip_monitor:** the command is not shown in [`MONITOR`](../monitor)'s output.\n- **skip_slowlog:** the command is not shown in [`SLOWLOG`](../slowlog)'s output. As of Redis 7.0, this flag is a [command tip](https://redis.io/topics/command-tips).\n- **stale:** the command is allowed while a replica has stale data.\n- **write:** the command may modify data.\n\n### Movablekeys\n\nConsider [`SORT`](../sort):\n\n```\n1) 1) \"sort\"\n   2) (integer) -2\n   3) 1) write\n      2) denyoom\n      3) movablekeys\n   4) (integer) 1\n   5) (integer) 1\n   6) (integer) 1\n   ...\n```\n\nSome Redis commands have no predetermined key locations or are not easy to find. For those commands, the *movablekeys* flag indicates that the *first key*, *last key*, and *step* values are insufficient to find all the keys.\n\nHere are several examples of commands that have the *movablekeys* flag:\n\n- [`SORT`](../sort): the optional *STORE*, *BY*, and *GET* modifiers are followed by names of keys.\n- [`ZUNION`](../zunion): the *numkeys* argument specifies the number key name arguments.\n- [`MIGRATE`](../migrate): the keys appear *KEYS* keyword and only when the second argument is the empty string.\n\nRedis Cluster clients need to use other measures, as follows, to locate the keys for such commands.\n\nYou can use the [`COMMAND GETKEYS`](../command-getkeys) command and have your Redis server report all keys of a given command's invocation.\n\nAs of Redis 7.0, clients can use the [key specifications](#key-specifications) to identify the positions of key names. The only commands that require using [`COMMAND GETKEYS`](../command-getkeys) are [`SORT`](../sort) and [`MIGRATE`](../migrate) for clients that parse keys' specifications.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [key specifications page](https://redis.io/topics/key-specs).\n\n## First key\n\nThe position of the command's first key name argument. For most commands, the first key's position is 1. Position 0 is always the command name itself.\n\n## Last key\n\nThe position of the command's last key name argument. Redis commands usually accept one, two or multiple number of keys.\n\nCommands that accept a single key have both *first key* and *last key* set to 1.\n\nCommands that accept two key name arguments, e.g. [`BRPOPLPUSH`](../brpoplpush), [`SMOVE`](../smove) and [`RENAME`](../rename), have this value set to the position of their second key.\n\nMulti-key commands that accept an arbitrary number of keys, such as [`MSET`](../mset), use the value -1.\n\n## Step\n\nThe step, or increment, between the *first key* and the position of the next key.\n\nConsider the following two examples:\n\n```\n1) 1) \"mset\"\n   2) (integer) -3\n   3) 1) write\n      2) denyoom\n   4) (integer) 1\n   5) (integer) -1\n   6) (integer) 2\n   ...\n```\n\n```\n1) 1) \"mget\"\n   2) (integer) -2\n   3) 1) readonly\n      2) fast\n   4) (integer) 1\n   5) (integer) -1\n   6) (integer) 1\n   ...\n```\n\nThe step count allows us to find keys' positions. For example [`MSET`](../mset): Its syntax is `MSET _key1_ _val1_ [key2] [val2] [key3] [val3]...`, so the keys are at every other position (step value of *2*). Unlike [`MGET`](../mget), which uses a step value of *1*.\n\n## ACL categories\n\nThis is an array of simple strings that are the ACL categories to which the command belongs. Please refer to the [Access Control List](https://redis.io/topics/acl) page for more information.\n\n## Command tips\n\nHelpful information about the command. To be used by clients/proxies.\n\nPlease check the [Command tips](https://redis.io/topics/command-tips) page for more information.\n\n## Key specifications\n\nThis is an array consisting of the command's key specifications. Each element in the array is a map describing a method for locating keys in the command's arguments.\n\nFor more information please check the [key specifications page](https://redis.io/topics/key-specs).\n\n## Subcommands\n\nThis is an array containing all of the command's subcommands, if any. Some Redis commands have subcommands (e.g., the `REWRITE` subcommand of [`CONFIG`](../config)). Each element in the array represents one subcommand and follows the same specifications as those of `COMMAND`'s reply.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): a nested list of command details.\n\nThe order of commands in the array is random.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following is `COMMAND`'s output for the [`GET`](../get) command:\n\n```\n1)  1) \"get\"\n    2) (integer) 2\n    3) 1) readonly\n       2) fast\n    4) (integer) 1\n    5) (integer) 1\n    6) (integer) 1\n    7) 1) @read\n       2) @string\n       3) @fast\n    8) (empty array)\n    9) 1) 1) \"flags\"\n          2) 1) read\n          3) \"begin_search\"\n          4) 1) \"type\"\n             2) \"index\"\n             3) \"spec\"\n             4) 1) \"index\"\n                2) (integer) 1\n          5) \"find_keys\"\n          6) 1) \"type\"\n             2) \"range\"\n             3) \"spec\"\n             4) 1) \"lastkey\"\n                2) (integer) 0\n                3) \"keystep\"\n                4) (integer) 1\n                5) \"limit\"\n                6) (integer) 0\n   10) (empty array)\n...\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/command/](https://redis.io/commands/command/)"

For instance if you used to have multiple `save` directives, but the current configuration has fewer or none as you disabled RDB persistence, all the lines will be blanked.\n\nCONFIG REWRITE is also able to rewrite the configuration file from scratch if the original one no longer exists for some reason. However if the server was started without a configuration file at all, the CONFIG REWRITE will just return an error.\n\n## Atomic rewrite process\n\nIn order to make sure the redis.conf file is always consistent, that is, on errors or crashes you always end with the old file, or the new one, the rewrite is performed with a single `write(2)` call that has enough content to be at least as big as the old file. Sometimes additional padding in the form of comments is added in order to make sure the resulting file is big enough, and later the file gets truncated to remove the padding at the end.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` when the configuration was rewritten properly.

You can change both trivial parameters or switch from one to another persistence option using this command.\n\nThe list of configuration parameters supported by `CONFIG SET` can be obtained issuing a `CONFIG GET *` command, that is the symmetrical command used to obtain information about the configuration of a running Redis instance.\n\nAll the configuration parameters set using `CONFIG SET` are immediately loaded by Redis and will take effect starting with the next command executed.\n\nAll the supported parameters have the same meaning of the equivalent configuration parameter used in the [redis.conf](http://github.com/redis/redis/raw/unstable/redis.conf) file.\n\nNote that you should look at the redis.conf file relevant to the version you're working with as configuration options might change between versions. The link above is to the latest development version.\n\nIt is possible to switch persistence from RDB snapshotting to append-only file (and the other way around) using the `CONFIG SET` command. For more information about how to do that please check the [persistence page](https://redis.io/topics/persistence).\n\nIn general what you should know is that setting the `appendonly` parameter to `yes` will start a background process to save the initial append-only file (obtained from the in memory data set), and will append all the subsequent commands on the append-only file, thus obtaining exactly the same effect of a Redis server that started with AOF turned on since the start.\n\nYou can have both the AOF enabled with RDB snapshotting if you want, the two options are not mutually exclusive.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` when the configuration was set properly.

  summary: Set a timeout on key
  description: "# EXPIRE\n\n    EXPIRE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nEXPIRE key seconds [NX | XX | GT | LT]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n1.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@keyspace`, `@write`, `@fast`,\n\nSet a timeout on `key`. After the timeout has expired, the key will automatically be deleted. A key with an associated timeout is often said to be *volatile* in Redis terminology.\n\nThe timeout will only be cleared by commands that delete or overwrite the contents of the key, including [`DEL`](../del), [`SET`](../set), [`GETSET`](../getset) and all the `*STORE` commands. This means that all the operations that conceptually *alter* the value stored at the key without replacing it with a new one will leave the timeout untouched. For instance, incrementing the value of a key with [`INCR`](../incr), pushing a new value into a list with [`LPUSH`](../lpush), or altering the field value of a hash with [`HSET`](../hset) are all operations that will leave the timeout untouched.\n\nThe timeout can also be cleared, turning the key back into a persistent key, using the [`PERSIST`](../persist) command.\n\nIf a key is renamed with [`RENAME`](../rename), the associated time to live is transferred to the new key name.\n\nIf a key is overwritten by [`RENAME`](../rename), like in the case of an existing key `Key_A` that is overwritten by a call like `RENAME Key_B Key_A`, it does not matter if the original `Key_A` had a timeout associated or not, the new key `Key_A` will inherit all the characteristics of `Key_B`.\n\nNote that calling `EXPIRE`/[`PEXPIRE`](../pexpire) with a non-positive timeout or [`EXPIREAT`](../expireat)/[`PEXPIREAT`](../pexpireat) with a time in the past will result in the key being [deleted](../del) rather than expired (accordingly, the emitted [key event](https://redis.io/topics/notifications) will be `del`, not `expired`).\n\n## Options\n\nThe `EXPIRE` command supports a set of options:\n\n- `NX` -- Set expiry only when the key has no expiry\n- `XX` -- Set expiry only when the key has an existing expiry\n- `GT` -- Set expiry only when the new expiry is greater than current one\n- `LT` -- Set expiry only when the new expiry is less than current one\n\nA non-volatile key is treated as an infinite TTL for the purpose of `GT` and `LT`. The `GT`, `LT` and `NX` options are mutually exclusive.\n\n## Refreshing expires\n\nIt is possible to call `EXPIRE` using as argument a key that already has an existing expire set. In this case the time to live of a key is *updated* to the new value. There are many useful applications for this, an example is documented in the *Navigation session* pattern section below.\n\n## Differences in Redis prior 2.1.3\n\nIn Redis versions prior **2.1.3** altering a key with an expire set using a command altering its value had the effect of removing the key entirely. This semantics was needed because of limitations in the replication layer that are now fixed.\n\n`EXPIRE` would return 0 and not alter the timeout for a key with a timeout set.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers), specifically:\n\n- `1` if the timeout was set.\n- `0` if the timeout was not set. e.g. key doesn't exist, or operation skipped due to the provided arguments.\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nSET mykey \"Hello\"\nEXPIRE mykey 10\nTTL mykey\nSET mykey \"Hello World\"\nTTL mykey\nEXPIRE mykey 10 XX\nTTL mykey\nEXPIRE mykey 10 NX\nTTL mykey\n```\n\n## Pattern: Navigation session\n\nImagine you have a web service and you are interested in the latest N pages *recently* visited by your users, such that each adjacent page view was not performed more than 60 seconds after the previous. Conceptually you may consider this set of page views as a *Navigation session* of your user, that may contain interesting information about what kind of products he or she is looking for currently, so that you can recommend related products.\n\nYou can easily model this pattern in Redis using the following strategy: every time the user does a page view you call the following commands:\n\n```\nMULTI\nRPUSH pagewviews.user:<userid> http://.....\nEXPIRE pagewviews.user:<userid> 60\nEXEC\n```\n\nIf the user will be idle more than 60 seconds, the key will be deleted and only subsequent page views that have less than 60 seconds of difference will be recorded.\n\nThis pattern is easily modified to use counters using [`INCR`](../incr) instead of lists using [`RPUSH`](../rpush).\n\n# Appendix: Redis expires\n\n## Keys with an expire\n\nNormally Redis keys are created without an associated time to live. The key will simply live forever, unless it is removed by the user in an explicit way, for instance using the [`DEL`](../del) command.\n\nThe `EXPIRE` family of commands is able to associate an expire to a given key, at the cost of some additional memory used by the key. When a key has an expire set, Redis will make sure to remove the key when the specified amount of time elapsed.\n\nThe key time to live can be updated or entirely removed using the `EXPIRE` and [`PERSIST`](../persist) command (or other strictly related commands).\n\n## Expire accuracy\n\nIn Redis 2.4 the expire might not be pin-point accurate, and it could be between zero to one seconds out.\n\nSince Redis 2.6 the expire error is from 0 to 1 milliseconds.\n\n## Expires and persistence\n\nKeys expiring information is stored as absolute Unix timestamps (in milliseconds in case of Redis version 2.6 or greater). This means that the time is flowing even when the Redis instance is not active.\n\nFor expires to work well, the computer time must be taken stable. If you move an RDB file from two computers with a big desync in their clocks, funny things may happen (like all the keys loaded to be expired at loading time).\n\nEven running instances will always check the computer clock, so for instance if you set a key with a time to live of 1000 seconds, and then set your computer time 2000 seconds in the future, the key will be expired immediately, instead of lasting for 1000 seconds.\n\n## How Redis expires keys\n\nRedis keys are expired in two ways: a passive way, and an active way.\n\nA key is passively expired simply when some client tries to access it, and the key is found to be timed out.\n\nOf course this is not enough as there are expired keys that will never be accessed again. These keys should be expired anyway, so periodically Redis tests a few keys at random among keys with an expire set. All the keys that are already expired are deleted from the keyspace.\n\nSpecifically this is what Redis does 10 times per second:\n\n1.  Test 20 random keys from the set of keys with an associated expire.\n2.  Delete all the keys found expired.\n3.  If more than 25% of keys were expired, start again from step 1.\n\nThis is a trivial probabilistic algorithm, basically the assumption is that our sample is representative of the whole key space, and we continue to expire until the percentage of keys that are likely to be expired is under 25%\n\nThis means that at any given moment the maximum amount of keys already expired that are using memory is at max equal to max amount of write operations per second divided by 4.\n\n## How expires are handled in the replication link and AOF file\n\nIn order to obtain a correct behavior without sacrificing consistency, when a key expires, a [`DEL`](../del) operation is synthesized in both the AOF file and gains all the attached replicas nodes. This way the expiration process is centralized in the master instance, and there is no chance of consistency errors.\n\nHowever while the replicas connected to a master will not expire keys independently (but will wait for the [`DEL`](../del) coming from the master), they'll still take the full state of the expires existing in the dataset, so when a replica is elected to master it will be able to expire the keys independently, fully acting as a master.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added options: `NX`, `XX`, `GT` and `LT`.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/expire/](https://redis.io/commands/expire/)"

  summary: This command will start a coordinated failover between the currently-connected-to master and one of its replicas
  description: "# FAILOVER\n\n    FAILOVER\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nFAILOVER [TO host port [FORCE]] [ABORT] [TIMEOUT milliseconds]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n6.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\nThis command will start a coordinated failover between the currently-connected-to master and one of its replicas. The failover is not synchronous, instead a background task will handle coordinating the failover. It is designed to limit data loss and unavailability of the cluster during the failover. This command is analogous to the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](../cluster-failover) command for non-clustered Redis and is similar to the failover support provided by sentinel.\n\nThe specific details of the default failover flow are as follows:\n\n1.  The master will internally start a `CLIENT PAUSE WRITE`, which will pause incoming writes and prevent the accumulation of new data in the replication stream.\n2.  The master will monitor its replicas, waiting for a replica to indicate that it has fully consumed the replication stream. If the master has multiple replicas, it will only wait for the first replica to catch up.\n3.  The master will then demote itself to a replica. This is done to prevent any dual master scenarios. NOTE: The master will not discard its data, so it will be able to rollback if the replica rejects the failover request in the next step.\n4.  The previous master will send a special PSYNC request to the target replica, `PSYNC FAILOVER`, instructing the target replica to become a master.\n5.  Once the previous master receives acknowledgement the `PSYNC FAILOVER` was accepted it will unpause its clients. If the PSYNC request is rejected, the master will abort the failover and return to normal.\n\nThe field `master_failover_state` in `INFO replication` can be used to track the current state of the failover, which has the following values:\n\n- `no-failover`: There is no ongoing coordinated failover.\n- `waiting-for-sync`: The master is waiting for the replica to catch up to its replication offset.\n- `failover-in-progress`: The master has demoted itself, and is attempting to hand off ownership to a target replica.\n\nIf the previous master had additional replicas attached to it, they will continue replicating from it as chained replicas. You will need to manually execute a [`REPLICAOF`](../replicaof) on these replicas to start replicating directly from the new master.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\nThe following optional arguments exist to modify the behavior of the failover flow:\n\n- `TIMEOUT` *milliseconds* -- This option allows specifying a maximum time a master will wait in the `waiting-for-sync` state before aborting the failover attempt and rolling back. This is intended to set an upper bound on the write outage the Redis cluster can experience. Failovers typically happen in less than a second, but could take longer if there is a large amount of write traffic or the replica is already behind in consuming the replication stream. If this value is not specified, the timeout can be considered to be \"infinite\".\n\n- `TO` *HOST* *PORT* -- This option allows designating a specific replica, by its host and port, to failover to. The master will wait specifically for this replica to catch up to its replication offset, and then failover to it.\n\n- `FORCE` -- If both the `TIMEOUT` and `TO` options are set, the force flag can also be used to designate that that once the timeout has elapsed, the master should failover to the target replica instead of rolling back. This can be used for a best-effort attempt at a failover without data loss, but limiting write outage.\n\nNOTE: The master will always rollback if the `PSYNC FAILOVER` request is rejected by the target replica.\n\n## Failover abort\n\nThe failover command is intended to be safe from data loss and corruption, but can encounter some scenarios it can not automatically remediate from and may get stuck. For this purpose, the `FAILOVER ABORT` command exists, which will abort an ongoing failover and return the master to its normal state. The command has no side effects if issued in the `waiting-for-sync` state but can introduce multi-master scenarios in the `failover-in-progress` state. If a multi-master scenario is encountered, you will need to manually identify which master has the latest data and designate it as the master and have the other replicas.\n\nNOTE: [`REPLICAOF`](../replicaof) is disabled while a failover is in progress, this is to prevent unintended interactions with the failover that might cause data loss.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if the command was accepted and a coordinated failover is in progress. An error if the operation cannot be executed.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/failover/](https://redis.io/commands/failover/)"

You must first create the index using [`FT.CREATE`](../ft.create).\n\n`query`\n\nis base filtering query that retrieves the documents. It follows the exact same syntax as the search query, including filters, unions, not, optional, and so on.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`VERBATIM`\n\nif set, does not try to use stemming for query expansion but searches the query terms verbatim.\n\n`LOAD {nargs} {identifier} AS {property} …`\n\nloads document attributes from the source document.\n\n- `identifier` is either an attribute name for hashes and JSON or a JSON Path expression for JSON.\n- `property` is the optional name used in the result. If it is not provided, the `identifier` is used. This should be avoided.\n- If `*` is used as `nargs`, all attributes in a document are loaded.\n\nAttributes needed for aggregations should be stored as `SORTABLE`, where they are available to the aggregation pipeline with very low latency. `LOAD` hurts the performance of aggregate queries considerably because every processed record needs to execute the equivalent of [`HMGET`](../hmget) against a Redis key, which when executed over millions of keys, amounts to high processing times.\n\n`GROUPBY {nargs} {property}`\n\ngroups the results in the pipeline based on one or more properties. Each group should have at least one *reducer*, a function that handles the group entries, either counting them, or performing multiple aggregate operations (see below).\n\n`REDUCE {func} {nargs} {arg} … [AS {name}]`\n\nreduces the matching results in each group into a single record, using a reduction function. For example, `COUNT` counts the number of records in the group. The reducers can have their own property names using the `AS {name}` optional argument. If a name is not given, the resulting name will be the name of the reduce function and the group properties. For example, if a name is not given to `COUNT_DISTINCT` by property `@foo`, the resulting name will be `count_distinct(@foo)`.\n\nSee [Supported GROUPBY reducers](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/aggregations/#supported-groupby-reducers) for more details.\n\n`SORTBY {nargs} {property} {ASC|DESC} [MAX {num}]`\n\nsorts the pipeline up until the point of `SORTBY`, using a list of properties.\n\n- By default, sorting is ascending, but `ASC` or `DESC ` can be added for each property.\n- `nargs` is the number of sorting parameters, including `ASC` and `DESC`, for example, `SORTBY 4 @foo ASC @bar DESC`.\n- `MAX` is used to optimized sorting, by sorting only for the n-largest elements. Although it is not connected to `LIMIT`, you usually need just `SORTBY … MAX` for common queries.\n\nAttributes needed for `SORTBY` should be stored as `SORTABLE` to be available with very low latency.\n\n`APPLY {expr} AS {name}`\n\napplies a 1-to-1 transformation on one or more properties and either stores the result as a new property down the pipeline or replaces any property using this transformation.\n\n`expr` is an expression that can be used to perform arithmetic operations on numeric properties, or functions that can be applied on properties depending on their types (see below), or any combination thereof. For example, `APPLY \"sqrt(@foo)/log(@bar) + 5\" AS baz` evaluates this expression dynamically for each record in the pipeline and store the result as a new property called `baz`, which can be referenced by further `APPLY`/`SORTBY`/`GROUPBY`/`REDUCE` operations down the pipeline.\n\n`LIMIT {offset} {num}`\n\nlimits the number of results to return just `num` results starting at index `offset` (zero-based). It is much more efficient to use `SORTBY … MAX` if you are interested in just limiting the output of a sort operation. If a key expires during the query, an attempt to `load` the key's value will return a null array.\n\nHowever, limit can be used to limit results without sorting, or for paging the n-largest results as determined by `SORTBY MAX`. For example, getting results 50-100 of the top 100 results is most efficiently expressed as `SORTBY 1 @foo MAX 100 LIMIT 50 50`. Removing the `MAX` from `SORTBY` results in the pipeline sorting *all* the records and then paging over results 50-100.\n\n`FILTER {expr}`\n\nfilters the results using predicate expressions relating to values in each result. They are applied post query and relate to the current state of the pipeline.\n\n`WITHCURSOR {COUNT} {read_size} [MAXIDLE {idle_time}]`\n\nScan part of the results with a quicker alternative than `LIMIT`. See [Cursor API](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/aggregations/#cursor-api) for more details.\n\n`TIMEOUT {milliseconds}`\n\nif set, overrides the timeout parameter of the module.\n\n`PARAMS {nargs} {name} {value}`\n\ndefines one or more value parameters. Each parameter has a name and a value.\n\nYou can reference parameters in the `query` by a `$`, followed by the parameter name, for example, `$user`. Each such reference in the search query to a parameter name is substituted by the corresponding parameter value. For example, with parameter definition `PARAMS 4 lon 29.69465 lat 34.95126`, the expression `@loc:[$lon $lat 10 km]` is evaluated to `@loc:[29.69465 34.95126 10 km]`. You cannot reference parameters in the query string where concrete values are not allowed, such as in field names, for example, `@loc`. To use `PARAMS`, set `DIALECT` to `2` or greater than `2`.\n\n`DIALECT {dialect_version}`\n\nselects the dialect version under which to execute the query. If not specified, the query will execute under the default dialect version set during module initial loading or via [`FT.CONFIG SET`](../ft.config-set) command.\n\n## Return\n\nFT.AGGREGATE returns an array reply where each row is an array reply and represents a single aggregate result. The [integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#resp-integers) at position `1` does not represent a valid value.\n\n### Return multiple values\n\nSee [Return multiple values](../ft.search#return-multiple-values) in [`FT.SEARCH`](../ft.search) The `DIALECT` can be specified as a parameter in the FT.AGGREGATE command. If it is not specified, the `DEFAULT_DIALECT` is used, which can be set using [`FT.CONFIG SET`](../ft.config-set) or by passing it as an argument to the `redisearch` module when it is loaded. For example, with the following document and index:\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET doc:1 $ '[{\"arr\": [1, 2, 3]}, {\"val\": \"hello\"}, {\"val\": \"world\"}]'\nOK\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE idx ON JSON PREFIX 1 doc: SCHEMA $..arr AS arr NUMERIC $..val AS val TEXT\nOK\n```\n\nNotice the different replies, with and without `DIALECT 3`:\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.AGGREGATE idx * LOAD 2 arr val \n1) (integer) 1\n2) 1) \"arr\"\n   2) \"[1,2,3]\"\n   3) \"val\"\n   4) \"hello\"\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.AGGREGATE idx * LOAD 2 arr val DIALECT 3\n1) (integer) 1\n2) 1) \"arr\"\n   2) \"[[1,2,3]]\"\n   3) \"val\"\n   4) \"[\\\"hello\\\",\\\"world\\\"]\"\n```\n\n## Complexity\n\nNon-deterministic. Depends on the query and aggregations performed, but it is usually linear to the number of results returned.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Sort page visits by day**\n\nFind visits to the page `about.html`, group them by the day of the visit, count the number of visits, and sort them by day.\n\n``` chroma\nFT.AGGREGATE idx \"@url:\\\"about.html\\\"\"\n    APPLY \"day(@timestamp)\" AS day\n    GROUPBY 2 @day @country\n      REDUCE count 0 AS num_visits\n    SORTBY 4 @day\n```\n\n**Find most books ever published**\n\nFind most books ever published in a single year.\n\n``` chroma\nFT.AGGREGATE books-idx *\n    GROUPBY 1 @published_year\n      REDUCE COUNT 0 AS num_published\n    GROUPBY 0\n      REDUCE MAX 1 @num_published AS max_books_published_per_year\n```\n\n**Reduce all results**\n\nThe last example used `GROUPBY 0`. Use `GROUPBY 0` to apply a `REDUCE` function over all results from the last step of an aggregation pipeline -- this works on both the initial query and subsequent `GROUPBY` operations.\n\nSearch for libraries within 10 kilometers of the longitude -73.982254 and latitude 40.753181 then annotate them with the distance between their location and those coordinates.\n\n``` chroma\n FT.AGGREGATE libraries-idx \"@location:[-73.982254 40.753181 10 km]\"\n    LOAD 1 @location\n    APPLY \"geodistance(@location, -73.982254, 40.753181)\"\n```\n\nHere, we needed to use `LOAD` to pre-load the `@location` attribute because it is a GEO attribute.\n\nNext, count GitHub events by user (actor), to produce the most active users.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.AGGREGATE gh \"*\" GROUPBY 1 @actor REDUCE COUNT 0 AS num SORTBY 2 @num DESC MAX 10\n 1) (integer) 284784\n 2) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"lombiqbot\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"22197\"\n 3) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"codepipeline-test\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"17746\"\n 4) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"direwolf-github\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"10683\"\n 5) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"ogate\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"6449\"\n 6) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"openlocalizationtest\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"4759\"\n 7) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"digimatic\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"3809\"\n 8) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"gugod\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"3512\"\n 9) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"xdzou\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"3216\"\n[10](10)) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"opstest\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"2863\"\n11) 1) \"actor\"\n    2) \"jikker\"\n    3) \"num\"\n    4) \"2794\"\n(0.59s)\n```\n\n## See also\n\n[`FT.CONFIG SET`](../ft.config-set) \\| [`FT.SEARCH`](../ft.search)\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Aggregations](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/aggregations)\n- [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search)\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/)"

If it exists, the old specification is overwritten.\n\n`SCHEMA {identifier} AS {attribute} {attribute type} {options...`\n\nafter the SCHEMA keyword, declares which fields to index:\n\n- `{identifier}` for hashes, is a field name within the hash. For JSON, the identifier is a JSON Path expression.\n\n- `AS {attribute}` defines the attribute associated to the identifier. For example, you can use this feature to alias a complex JSONPath expression with more memorable (and easier to type) name.\n\nField types are:\n\n- `TEXT` - Allows full-text search queries against the value in this attribute.\n\n- `TAG` - Allows exact-match queries, such as categories or primary keys, against the value in this attribute. For more information, see [Tag Fields](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/tags).\n\n- `NUMERIC` - Allows numeric range queries against the value in this attribute. See [query syntax docs](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax) for details on how to use numeric ranges.\n\n- `GEO` - Allows geographic range queries against the value in this attribute. The value of the attribute must be a string containing a longitude (first) and latitude separated by a comma.\n\n- `VECTOR` - Allows vector similarity queries against the value in this attribute. For more information, see [Vector Fields](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/vectors).\n\nField options are:\n\n- `SORTABLE` - `NUMERIC`, `TAG`, `TEXT`, or `GEO` attributes can have an optional **SORTABLE** argument. As the user [sorts the results by the value of this attribute](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/sorting), the results are available with very low latency. Note that his adds memory overhead, so consider not declaring it on large text attributes. You can sort an attribute without the `SORTABLE` option, but the latency is not as good as with `SORTABLE`.\n\n- `UNF` - By default, for hashes (not with JSON) `SORTABLE` applies a normalization to the indexed value (characters set to lowercase, removal of diacritics). When using the unnormalized form (UNF), you can disable the normalization and keep the original form of the value. With JSON, `UNF` is implicit with `SORTABLE` (normalization is disabled).\n\n- `NOSTEM` - Text attributes can have the NOSTEM argument that disables stemming when indexing its values. This may be ideal for things like proper names.\n\n- `NOINDEX` - Attributes can have the `NOINDEX` option, which means they will not be indexed. This is useful in conjunction with `SORTABLE`, to create attributes whose update using PARTIAL will not cause full reindexing of the document. If an attribute has NOINDEX and doesn't have SORTABLE, it will just be ignored by the index.\n\n- `PHONETIC {matcher}` - Declaring a text attribute as `PHONETIC` will perform phonetic matching on it in searches by default. The obligatory {matcher} argument specifies the phonetic algorithm and language used. The following matchers are supported:\n\n  - `dm:en` - Double metaphone for English\n  - `dm:fr` - Double metaphone for French\n  - `dm:pt` - Double metaphone for Portuguese\n  - `dm:es` - Double metaphone for Spanish\n\n  For more information, see [Phonetic Matching](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/phonetic_matching).\n\n- `WEIGHT {weight}` for `TEXT` attributes, declares the importance of this attribute when calculating result accuracy. This is a multiplication factor, and defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\n- `SEPARATOR {sep}` for `TAG` attributes, indicates how the text contained in the attribute is to be split into individual tags. The default is `,`. The value must be a single character.\n\n- `CASESENSITIVE` for `TAG` attributes, keeps the original letter cases of the tags. If not specified, the characters are converted to lowercase.\n\n- `WITHSUFFIXTRIE` for `TEXT` and `TAG` attributes, keeps a suffix trie with all terms which match the suffix. It is used to optimize `contains` (*foo*) and `suffix` (\\*foo) queries. Otherwise, a brute-force search on the trie is performed. If suffix trie exists for some fields, these queries will be disabled for other fields.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`ON {data_type}`\n\ncurrently supports HASH (default) and JSON. To index JSON, you must have the [RedisJSON](https://redis.io/docs/stack/json) module installed.\n\n`PREFIX {count} {prefix}`\n\ntells the index which keys it should index. You can add several prefixes to index. Because the argument is optional, the default is `*` (all keys).\n\n`FILTER {filter}`\n\nis a filter expression with the full RediSearch aggregation expression language. It is possible to use `@__key` to access the key that was just added/changed. A field can be used to set field name by passing `'FILTER @indexName==\"myindexname\"'`.\n\n`LANGUAGE {default_lang}`\n\nif set, indicates the default language for documents in the index. Default is English.\n\n`LANGUAGE_FIELD {lang_attribute}`\n\nis document attribute set as the document language.\n\nA stemmer is used for the supplied language during indexing. If an unsupported language is sent, the command returns an error. The supported languages are Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Lithuanian, Nepali, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish, and Chinese.\n\nWhen adding Chinese language documents, set `LANGUAGE chinese` for the indexer to properly tokenize the terms. If you use the default language, then search terms are extracted based on punctuation characters and whitespace. The Chinese language tokenizer makes use of a segmentation algorithm (via [Friso](https://github.com/lionsoul2014/friso)), which segments text and checks it against a predefined dictionary. See [Stemming](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/stemming) for more information.\n\n`SCORE {default_score}`\n\nis default score for documents in the index. Default score is 1.0.\n\n`SCORE_FIELD {score_attribute}`\n\nis document attribute that you use as the document rank based on the user ranking. Ranking must be between 0.0 and 1.0. If not set, the default score is 1.\n\n`PAYLOAD_FIELD {payload_attribute}`\n\nis document attribute that you use as a binary safe payload string to the document that can be evaluated at query time by a custom scoring function or retrieved to the client.\n\n`MAXTEXTFIELDS`\n\nforces RediSearch to encode indexes as if there were more than 32 text attributes, which allows you to add additional attributes (beyond 32) using [`FT.ALTER`](../ft.alter). For efficiency, RediSearch encodes indexes differently if they are created with less than 32 text attributes.\n\n`NOOFFSETS`\n\ndoes not store term offsets for documents. It saves memory, but does not allow exact searches or highlighting. It implies `NOHL`.\n\n`TEMPORARY {seconds}`\n\ncreates a lightweight temporary index that expires after a specified period of inactivity, in seconds. The internal idle timer is reset whenever the index is searched or added to. Because such indexes are lightweight, you can create thousands of such indexes without negative performance implications and, therefore, you should consider using `SKIPINITIALSCAN` to avoid costly scanning.\n\nWarning\n\nWhen temporary indexes expire, they drop all the records associated with them. [`FT.DROPINDEX`](../ft.dropindex) was introduced with a default of not deleting docs and a `DD` flag that enforced deletion. However, for temporary indexes, documents are deleted along with the index. Historically, RediSearch used an FT.ADD command, which made a connection between the document and the index. Then, FT.DROP, also a hystoric command, deleted documents by default. In version 2.x, RediSearch indexes hashes and JSONs, and the dependency between the index and documents no longer exists.\n\n`NOHL`\n\nconserves storage space and memory by disabling highlighting support. If set, the corresponding byte offsets for term positions are not stored. `NOHL` is also implied by `NOOFFSETS`.\n\n`NOFIELDS`\n\ndoes not store attribute bits for each term. It saves memory, but it does not allow filtering by specific attributes.\n\n`NOFREQS`\n\navoids saving the term frequencies in the index. It saves memory, but does not allow sorting based on the frequencies of a given term within the document.\n\n`STOPWORDS {count}`\n\nsets the index with a custom stopword list, to be ignored during indexing and search time. `{count}` is the number of stopwords, followed by a list of stopword arguments exactly the length of `{count}`.\n\nIf not set, FT.CREATE takes the default list of stopwords. If `{count}` is set to 0, the index does not have stopwords.\n\n`SKIPINITIALSCAN`\n\nif set, does not scan and index.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Attribute number limits:** RediSearch supports up to 1024 attributes per schema, out of which at most 128 can be TEXT attributes. On 32 bit builds, at most 64 attributes can be TEXT attributes. The more attributes you have, the larger your index, as each additional 8 attributes require one extra byte per index record to encode. You can always use the `NOFIELDS` option and not encode attribute information into the index, for saving space, if you do not need filtering by text attributes. This will still allow filtering by numeric and geo attributes.\n\n- **Running in clustered databases:** When having several indices in a clustered database, you need to make sure the documents you want to index reside on the same shard as the index. You can achieve this by having your documents tagged by the index name.\n\n  ``` chroma\n  127.0.0.1:6379> HSET doc:1{idx} ...\n  127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE idx ... PREFIX 1 doc: ...\n  ```\n\n  When Running RediSearch in a clustered database, you can span the index across shards using [RSCoordinator](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/RSCoordinator). In this case the above does not apply.\n\n## Return\n\nFT.CREATE returns a simple string reply `OK` if executed correctly, or an error reply otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Create an index**\n\nCreate an index that stores the title, publication date, and categories of blog post hashes whose keys start with `blog:post:` (for example, `blog:post:1`).\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 blog:post: SCHEMA title TEXT SORTABLE published_at NUMERIC SORTABLE category TAG SORTABLE\nOK\n```\n\nIndex the `sku` attribute from a hash as both a `TAG` and as `TEXT`:\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 blog:post: SCHEMA sku AS sku_text TEXT sku AS sku_tag TAG SORTABLE\n```\n\nIndex two different hashes, one containing author data and one containing books, in the same index:\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE author-books-idx ON HASH PREFIX 2 author:details: book:details: SCHEMA\nauthor_id TAG SORTABLE author_ids TAG title TEXT name TEXT\n```\n\nIn this example, keys for author data use the key pattern `author:details:<id>` while keys for book data use the pattern `book:details:<id>`.\n\n**Index a JSON document using a JSON Path expression**\n\nIndex authors whose names start with G.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE g-authors-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 author:details FILTER 'startswith(@name, \"G\")' SCHEMA name TEXT\n```\n\nIndex only books that have a subtitle.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE subtitled-books-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 book:details FILTER '@subtitle != \"\"' SCHEMA title TEXT\n```\n\nIndex books that have a \"categories\" attribute where each category is separated by a `;` character.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE books-idx ON HASH PREFIX 1 book:details FILTER SCHEMA title TEXT categories TAG SEPARATOR \";\"\n```\n\nIndex a JSON document using a JSON Path expression.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE idx ON JSON SCHEMA $.title AS title TEXT $.categories AS categories TAG\n```\n\n## See also\n\n[`FT.ALTER`](../ft.alter) \\| [`FT.DROPINDEX`](../ft.dropindex)\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search)\n- [RedisJSON](https://redis.io/docs/stack/json)\n- [Friso](https://github.com/lionsoul2014/friso)\n- [Stemming](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/stemming)\n- [Phonetic Matching](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/phonetic_matching)\n- [RSCoordinator](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/RSCoordinator)\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 2.0.0: Added `PAYLOAD_FIELD` argument for backward support of `FT.SEARCH` deprecated `WITHPAYLOADS` argument\n- Starting with Redis version 2.0.0: Deprecated `PAYLOAD_FIELD` argument\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/)"

You must first create the index using [`FT.CREATE`](../ft.create).\n\n`query`\n\nis text query to search. If it's more than a single word, put it in quotes. Refer to [Query syntax](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax) for more details.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`NOCONTENT`\n\nreturns the document ids and not the content. This is useful if RediSearch is only an index on an external document collection.\n\n`VERBATIM`\n\ndoes not try to use stemming for query expansion but searches the query terms verbatim.\n\n`WITHSCORES`\n\nalso returns the relative internal score of each document. This can be used to merge results from multiple instances.\n\n`WITHPAYLOADS`\n\nretrieves optional document payloads. See [`FT.CREATE`](../ft.create). The payloads follow the document id and, if `WITHSCORES` is set, the scores.\n\n`WITHSORTKEYS`\n\nreturns the value of the sorting key, right after the id and score and/or payload, if requested. This is usually not needed, and exists for distributed search coordination purposes. This option is relevant only if used in conjunction with `SORTBY`.\n\n`FILTER numeric_attribute min max`\n\nlimits results to those having numeric values ranging between `min` and `max`, if numeric_attribute is defined as a numeric attribute in [`FT.CREATE`](../ft.create). `min` and `max` follow [`ZRANGE`](../zrange) syntax, and can be `-inf`, `+inf`, and use `(` for exclusive ranges. Multiple numeric filters for different attributes are supported in one query.\n\n`GEOFILTER {geo_attribute} {lon} {lat} {radius} m|km|mi|ft`\n\nfilter the results to a given `radius` from `lon` and `lat`. Radius is given as a number and units. See [`GEORADIUS`](../georadius) for more details.\n\n`INKEYS {num} {attribute} ...`\n\nlimits the result to a given set of keys specified in the list. The first argument must be the length of the list and greater than zero. Non-existent keys are ignored, unless all the keys are non-existent.\n\n`INFIELDS {num} {attribute} ...`\n\nfilters the results to those appearing only in specific attributes of the document, like `title` or `URL`. You must include `num`, which is the number of attributes you're filtering by. For example, if you request `title` and `URL`, then `num` is 2.\n\n`RETURN {num} {identifier} AS {property} ...`\n\nlimits the attributes returned from the document. `num` is the number of attributes following the keyword. If `num` is 0, it acts like `NOCONTENT`. `identifier` is either an attribute name (for hashes and JSON) or a JSON Path expression (for JSON). `property` is an optional name used in the result. If not provided, the `identifier` is used in the result.\n\n`SUMMARIZE ...`\n\nreturns only the sections of the attribute that contain the matched text. See [Highlighting](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/highlight) for more information.\n\n`HIGHLIGHT ...`\n\nformats occurrences of matched text. See [Highlighting](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/highlight) for more information.\n\n`SLOP {slop}`\n\nis the number of intermediate terms allowed to appear between the terms of the query. Suppose you're searching for a phrase *hello world*. If some terms appear in-between *hello* and *world*, a `SLOP` greater than `0` allows for these text attributes to match. By default, there is no `SLOP` constraint.\n\n`INORDER`\n\nrequires the terms in the document to have the same order as the terms in the query, regardless of the offsets between them. Typically used in conjunction with `SLOP`. Default is `false`.\n\n`LANGUAGE {language}`\n\nuse a stemmer for the supplied language during search for query expansion. If querying documents in Chinese, set to `chinese` to properly tokenize the query terms. Defaults to English. If an unsupported language is sent, the command returns an error. See [`FT.CREATE`](../ft.create) for the list of languages.\n\n`EXPANDER {expander}`\n\nuses a custom query expander instead of the stemmer. See [Extensions](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/extensions).\n\n`SCORER {scorer}`\n\nuses a custom scoring function you define. See [Extensions](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/extensions).\n\n`EXPLAINSCORE`\n\nreturns a textual description of how the scores were calculated. Using this option requires `WITHSCORES`.\n\n`PAYLOAD {payload}`\n\nadds an arbitrary, binary safe payload that is exposed to custom scoring functions. See [Extensions](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/extensions).\n\n`SORTBY {attribute} [ASC|DESC]`\n\norders the results by the value of this attribute. This applies to both text and numeric attributes. Attributes needed for `SORTBY` should be declared as `SORTABLE` in the index, in order to be available with very low latency. Note that this adds memory overhead.\n\n`LIMIT first num`\n\nlimits the results to the offset and number of results given. Note that the offset is zero-indexed. The default is 0 10, which returns 10 items starting from the first result. You can use `LIMIT 0 0` to count the number of documents in the result set without actually returning them.\n\n`TIMEOUT {milliseconds}`\n\noverrides the timeout parameter of the module.\n\n`PARAMS {nargs} {name} {value}`\n\ndefines one or more value parameters. Each parameter has a name and a value.\n\nYou can reference parameters in the `query` by a `$`, followed by the parameter name, for example, `$user`. Each such reference in the search query to a parameter name is substituted by the corresponding parameter value. For example, with parameter definition `PARAMS 4 lon 29.69465 lat 34.95126`, the expression `@loc:[$lon $lat 10 km]` is evaluated to `@loc:[29.69465 34.95126 10 km]`. You cannot reference parameters in the query string where concrete values are not allowed, such as in field names, for example, `@loc`. To use `PARAMS`, set `DIALECT` to `2` or greater than `2`.\n\n`DIALECT {dialect_version}`\n\nselects the dialect version under which to execute the query. If not specified, the query will execute under the default dialect version set during module initial loading or via [`FT.CONFIG SET`](../ft.config-set) command.\n\n## Return\n\nFT.SEARCH returns an array reply, where the first element is an integer reply of the total number of results, and then array reply pairs of document ids, and array replies of attribute/value pairs.\n\nNotes\n\n- If `NOCONTENT` is given, an array is returned where the first element is the total number of results, and the rest of the members are document ids.\n- If a hash expires after the query process starts, the hash is counted in the total number of results, but the key name and content return as null.\n\n### Return multiple values\n\nWhen the index is defined `ON JSON`, a reply for a single attribute or a single JSONPath may return multiple values when the JSONPath matches multiple values, or when the JSONPath matches an array.\n\nPrior to RediSearch v2.6, only the first of the matched values was returned. Starting with RediSearch v2.6, all values are returned, wrapped with a top-level array.\n\nIn order to maintain backward compatibility, the default behavior with RediSearch v2.6 is to return only the first value.\n\nTo return all the values, use `DIALECT` 3 (or greater, when available).\n\nThe `DIALECT` can be specified as a parameter in the FT.SEARCH command. If it is not specified, the `DEFAULT_DIALECT` is used, which can be set using [`FT.CONFIG SET`](../ft.config-set) or by passing it as an argument to the `redisearch` module when it is loaded.\n\nFor example, with the following document and index:\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET doc:1 $ '[{\"arr\": [1, 2, 3]}, {\"val\": \"hello\"}, {\"val\": \"world\"}]'\nOK\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE idx ON JSON PREFIX 1 doc: SCHEMA $..arr AS arr NUMERIC $..val AS val TEXT\nOK\n```\n\nNotice the different replies, with and without `DIALECT 3`:\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH idx * RETURN 2 arr val\n1) (integer) 1\n2) \"doc:1\"\n3) 1) \"arr\"\n   2) \"[1,2,3]\"\n   3) \"val\"\n   4) \"hello\"\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH idx * RETURN 2 arr val DIALECT 3\n1) (integer) 1\n2) \"doc:1\"\n3) 1) \"arr\"\n   2) \"[[1,2,3]]\"\n   3) \"val\"\n   4) \"[\\\"hello\\\",\\\"world\\\"]\"\n```\n\n## Complexity\n\nFT.SEARCH complexity is O(n) for single word queries. `n` is the number of the results in the result set. Finding all the documents that have a specific term is O(1), however, a scan on all those documents is needed to load the documents data from redis hashes and return them.\n\nThe time complexity for more complex queries varies, but in general it's proportional to the number of words, the number of intersection points between them and the number of results in the result set.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Search for a term in every text attribute**\n\nSearch for the term \"wizard\" in every TEXT attribute of an index containing book data.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"wizard\"\n```\n\n**Search for a term in title attribute**\n\nSearch for the term *dogs* in the `title` attribute.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"@title:dogs\"\n```\n\n**Search for books from specific years**\n\nSearch for books published in 2020 or 2021.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"@published_at:[2020 2021]\"\n```\n\n**Search for a restaurant by distance from longitude/latitude**\n\nSearch for Chinese restaurants within 5 kilometers of longitude -122.41, latitude 37.77 (San Francisco).\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH restaurants-idx \"chinese @location:[-122.41 37.77 5 km]\"\n```\n\n**Search for a book by terms but boost specific term**\n\nSearch for the term *dogs* or *cats* in the `title` attribute, but give matches of *dogs* a higher relevance score (also known as *boosting*).\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"(@title:dogs | @title:cats) | (@title:dogs) => { $weight: 5.0; }\"\n```\n\n**Search for a book by a term and EXPLAINSCORE**\n\nSearch for books with *dogs* in any TEXT attribute in the index and request an explanation of scoring for each result.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"dogs\" WITHSCORES EXPLAINSCORE\n```\n\n**Search for a book by a term and TAG**\n\nSearch for books with *space* in the title that have `science` in the TAG attribute `categories`.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"@title:space @categories:{science}\"\n```\n\n**Search for a book by a term but limit the number**\n\nSearch for books with *Python* in any `TEXT` attribute, returning 10 results starting with the 11th result in the entire result set (the offset parameter is zero-based), and return only the `title` attribute for each result.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"python\" LIMIT 10 10 RETURN 1 title\n```\n\n**Search for a book by a term and price**\n\nSearch for books with *Python* in any `TEXT` attribute, returning the price stored in the original JSON document.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> FT.SEARCH books-idx \"python\" RETURN 3 $.book.price AS price\n```\n\n**Search for a book by title and distance**\n\nSearch for books with semantically similar title to *Planet Earth*.

  description: "# GEOADD\n\n    GEOADD\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nGEOADD key [NX | XX] [CH] longitude latitude member [longitude\n  latitude member ...]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n3.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(log(N)) for each item added, where N is the number of elements in the sorted set.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@geo`, `@slow`,\n\nAdds the specified geospatial items (longitude, latitude, name) to the specified key. Data is stored into the key as a sorted set, in a way that makes it possible to query the items with the [`GEOSEARCH`](../geosearch) command.\n\nThe command takes arguments in the standard format x,y so the longitude must be specified before the latitude. There are limits to the coordinates that can be indexed: areas very near to the poles are not indexable.\n\nThe exact limits, as specified by EPSG:900913 / EPSG:3785 / OSGEO:41001 are the following:\n\n- Valid longitudes are from -180 to 180 degrees.\n- Valid latitudes are from -85.05112878 to 85.05112878 degrees.\n\nThe command will report an error when the user attempts to index coordinates outside the specified ranges.\n\n**Note:** there is no **GEODEL** command because you can use [`ZREM`](../zrem) to remove elements. The Geo index structure is just a sorted set.\n\n## GEOADD options\n\n`GEOADD` also provides the following options:\n\n- **XX**: Only update elements that already exist. Never add elements.\n- **NX**: Don't update already existing elements. Always add new elements.\n- **CH**: Modify the return value from the number of new elements added, to the total number of elements changed (CH is an abbreviation of *changed*). Changed elements are **new elements added** and elements already existing for which **the coordinates was updated**. So elements specified in the command line having the same score as they had in the past are not counted. Note: normally, the return value of `GEOADD` only counts the number of new elements added.\n\nNote: The **XX** and **NX** options are mutually exclusive.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThe way the sorted set is populated is using a technique called [Geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash). Latitude and Longitude bits are interleaved to form a unique 52-bit integer. We know that a sorted set double score can represent a 52-bit integer without losing precision.\n\nThis format allows for bounding box and radius querying by checking the 1+8 areas needed to cover the whole shape and discarding elements outside it. The areas are checked by calculating the range of the box covered, removing enough bits from the less significant part of the sorted set score, and computing the score range to query in the sorted set for each area.\n\n## What Earth model does it use?\n\nThe model assumes that the Earth is a sphere since it uses the Haversine formula to calculate distance. This formula is only an approximation when applied to the Earth, which is not a perfect sphere. The introduced errors are not an issue when used, for example, by social networks and similar applications requiring this type of querying. However, in the worst case, the error may be up to 0.5%, so you may want to consider other systems for error-critical applications.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers), specifically:\n\n- When used without optional arguments, the number of elements added to the sorted set (excluding score updates).\n- If the `CH` option is specified, the number of elements that were changed (added or updated).\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nGEOADD Sicily 13.361389 38.115556 \"Palermo\" 15.087269 37.502669 \"Catania\"\nGEODIST Sicily Palermo Catania\nGEORADIUS Sicily 15 37 100 km\nGEORADIUS Sicily 15 37 200 km\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: Added the `CH`, `NX` and `XX` options.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/geoadd/](https://redis.io/commands/geoadd/)"

  description: "# GEORADIUS\n\n    GEORADIUS (deprecated)\n\nAs of Redis version 6.2.0, this command is regarded as deprecated.\n\nIt can be replaced by [`GEOSEARCH`](../geosearch) and [`GEOSEARCHSTORE`](../geosearchstore) with the `BYRADIUS` argument when migrating or writing new code.\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nGEORADIUS key longitude latitude radius <M | KM | FT | MI>\n  [WITHCOORD] [WITHDIST] [WITHHASH] [COUNT count [ANY]] [ASC | DESC]\n  [STORE key] [STOREDIST key]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n3.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N+log(M)) where N is the number of elements inside the bounding box of the circular area delimited by center and radius and M is the number of items inside the index.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@geo`, `@slow`,\n\nReturn the members of a sorted set populated with geospatial information using [`GEOADD`](../geoadd), which are within the borders of the area specified with the center location and the maximum distance from the center (the radius).\n\nThis manual page also covers the [`GEORADIUS_RO`](../georadius_ro) and [`GEORADIUSBYMEMBER_RO`](../georadiusbymember_ro) variants (see the section below for more information).\n\nThe common use case for this command is to retrieve geospatial items near a specified point not farther than a given amount of meters (or other units). This allows, for example, to suggest mobile users of an application nearby places.\n\nThe radius is specified in one of the following units:\n\n- **m** for meters.\n- **km** for kilometers.\n- **mi** for miles.\n- **ft** for feet.\n\nThe command optionally returns additional information using the following options:\n\n- `WITHDIST`: Also return the distance of the returned items from the specified center. The distance is returned in the same unit as the unit specified as the radius argument of the command.\n- `WITHCOORD`: Also return the longitude,latitude coordinates of the matching items.\n- `WITHHASH`: Also return the raw geohash-encoded sorted set score of the item, in the form of a 52 bit unsigned integer. This is only useful for low level hacks or debugging and is otherwise of little interest for the general user.\n\nThe command default is to return unsorted items. Two different sorting methods can be invoked using the following two options:\n\n- `ASC`: Sort returned items from the nearest to the farthest, relative to the center.\n- `DESC`: Sort returned items from the farthest to the nearest, relative to the center.\n\nBy default all the matching items are returned. It is possible to limit the results to the first N matching items by using the **COUNT `<count>`** option. When `ANY` is provided the command will return as soon as enough matches are found, so the results may not be the ones closest to the specified point, but on the other hand, the effort invested by the server is significantly lower. When `ANY` is not provided, the command will perform an effort that is proportional to the number of items matching the specified area and sort them, so to query very large areas with a very small `COUNT` option may be slow even if just a few results are returned.\n\nBy default the command returns the items to the client. It is possible to store the results with one of these options:\n\n- `STORE`: Store the items in a sorted set populated with their geospatial information.\n- `STOREDIST`: Store the items in a sorted set populated with their distance from the center as a floating point number, in the same unit specified in the radius.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\n- Without any `WITH` option specified, the command just returns a linear array like \\[\"New York\",\"Milan\",\"Paris\"\\].\n- If `WITHCOORD`, `WITHDIST` or `WITHHASH` options are specified, the command returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents a single item.\n\nWhen additional information is returned as an array of arrays for each item, the first item in the sub-array is always the name of the returned item. The other information is returned in the following order as successive elements of the sub-array.\n\n1.  The distance from the center as a floating point number, in the same unit specified in the radius.\n2.  The geohash integer.\n3.  The coordinates as a two items x,y array (longitude,latitude).\n\nSo for example the command `GEORADIUS Sicily 15 37 200 km WITHCOORD WITHDIST` will return each item in the following way:\n\n    [\"Palermo\",\"190.4424\",[\"13.361389338970184\",\"38.115556395496299\"]]\n\n## Read-only variants\n\nSince `GEORADIUS` and [`GEORADIUSBYMEMBER`](../georadiusbymember) have a `STORE` and `STOREDIST` option they are technically flagged as writing commands in the Redis command table. For this reason read-only replicas will flag them, and Redis Cluster replicas will redirect them to the master instance even if the connection is in read-only mode (see the [`READONLY`](../readonly) command of Redis Cluster).\n\nBreaking the compatibility with the past was considered but rejected, at least for Redis 4.0, so instead two read-only variants of the commands were added. They are exactly like the original commands but refuse the `STORE` and `STOREDIST` options. The two variants are called [`GEORADIUS_RO`](../georadius_ro) and [`GEORADIUSBYMEMBER_RO`](../georadiusbymember_ro), and can safely be used in replicas.\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nGEOADD Sicily 13.361389 38.115556 \"Palermo\" 15.087269 37.502669 \"Catania\"\nGEORADIUS Sicily 15 37 200 km WITHDIST\nGEORADIUS Sicily 15 37 200 km WITHCOORD\nGEORADIUS Sicily 15 37 200 km WITHDIST WITHCOORD\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: Added the `ANY` option for `COUNT`.\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added support for uppercase unit names.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/georadius/](https://redis.io/commands/georadius/)"

This command extends the [`GEORADIUS`](../georadius) command, so in addition to searching within circular areas, it supports searching within rectangular areas.\n\nThis command should be used in place of the deprecated [`GEORADIUS`](../georadius) and [`GEORADIUSBYMEMBER`](../georadiusbymember) commands.\n\nThe query's center point is provided by one of these mandatory options:\n\n- `FROMMEMBER`: Use the position of the given existing `<member>` in the sorted set.\n- `FROMLONLAT`: Use the given `<longitude>` and `<latitude>` position.\n\nThe query's shape is provided by one of these mandatory options:\n\n- `BYRADIUS`: Similar to [`GEORADIUS`](../georadius), search inside circular area according to given `<radius>`.\n- `BYBOX`: Search inside an axis-aligned rectangle, determined by `<height>` and `<width>`.\n\nThe command optionally returns additional information using the following options:\n\n- `WITHDIST`: Also return the distance of the returned items from the specified center point. The distance is returned in the same unit as specified for the radius or height and width arguments.\n- `WITHCOORD`: Also return the longitude and latitude of the matching items.\n- `WITHHASH`: Also return the raw geohash-encoded sorted set score of the item, in the form of a 52 bit unsigned integer. This is only useful for low level hacks or debugging and is otherwise of little interest for the general user.\n\nMatching items are returned unsorted by default. To sort them, use one of the following two options:\n\n- `ASC`: Sort returned items from the nearest to the farthest, relative to the center point.\n- `DESC`: Sort returned items from the farthest to the nearest, relative to the center point.\n\nAll matching items are returned by default. To limit the results to the first N matching items, use the **COUNT `<count>`** option. When the `ANY` option is used, the command returns as soon as enough matches are found. This means that the results returned may not be the ones closest to the specified point, but the effort invested by the server to generate them is significantly less. When `ANY` is not provided, the command will perform an effort that is proportional to the number of items matching the specified area and sort them, so to query very large areas with a very small `COUNT` option may be slow even if just a few results are returned.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\n- Without any `WITH` option specified, the command just returns a linear array like \\[\"New York\",\"Milan\",\"Paris\"\\].\n- If `WITHCOORD`, `WITHDIST` or `WITHHASH` options are specified, the command returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents a single item.\n\nWhen additional information is returned as an array of arrays for each item, the first item in the sub-array is always the name of the returned item. The other information is returned in the following order as successive elements of the sub-array.\n\n1.  The distance from the center as a floating point number, in the same unit specified in the shape.\n2.  The geohash integer.\n3.  The coordinates as a two items x,y array (longitude,latitude).\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nGEOADD Sicily 13.361389 38.115556 \"Palermo\" 15.087269 37.502669 \"Catania\"\nGEOADD Sicily 12.758489 38.788135 \"edge1\"   17.241510 38.788135 \"edge2\" \nGEOSEARCH Sicily FROMLONLAT 15 37 BYRADIUS 200 km ASC\nGEOSEARCH Sicily FROMLONLAT 15 37 BYBOX 400 400 km ASC WITHCOORD WITHDIST\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added support for uppercase unit names.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/geosearch/](https://redis.io/commands/geosearch/)"

  summary: Executes the given query against a specified graph
  description: "# GRAPH.QUERY\n\n    GRAPH.QUERY\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nGRAPH.QUERY graph query [TIMEOUT timeout]\n```\n\nAvailable in:\n\n[Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack) / [Graph 1.0.0](https://redis.io/docs/stack/graph)\n\nTime complexity:\n\nExecutes the given query against a specified graph.\n\nArguments: `Graph name, Query, Timeout [optional]`\n\nReturns: [Result set](https://redis.io/docs/stack/graph/design/result_structure)\n\n### Queries and Parameterized Queries\n\nThe execution plans of queries, both regular and parameterized, are cached (up to [CACHE_SIZE](https://redis.io/docs/stack/graph/configuration/#cache_size) unique queries are cached). Therefore, it is recommended to use parametrized queries when executing many queries with the same pattern but different constants.\n\nQuery-level timeouts can be set as described in [the configuration section](https://redis.io/docs/stack/graph/configuration#timeout).\n\n#### Query structure:\n\n`GRAPH.QUERY graph_name \"query\"`\n\nexample:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY us_government \"MATCH (p:president)-[:born]->(:state {name:'Hawaii'}) RETURN p\"\n```\n\n#### Parametrized query structure:\n\n`GRAPH.QUERY graph_name \"CYPHER param=val [param=val ...] query\"`\n\nexample:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY us_government \"CYPHER state_name='Hawaii' MATCH (p:president)-[:born]->(:state {name:$state_name}) RETURN p\"\n```\n\n### Query language\n\nThe syntax is based on [Cypher](http://www.opencypher.org/). [Most](https://redis.io/docs/stack/graph/cypher_support/) of the language is supported. RedisGraph-specific extensions are also described below.\n\n1.  [Clauses](#query-structure)\n2.  [Functions](#functions)\n\n### Query structure\n\n- [MATCH](#match)\n- [OPTIONAL MATCH](#optional-match)\n- [WHERE](#where)\n- [RETURN](#return)\n- [ORDER BY](#order-by)\n- [SKIP](#skip)\n- [LIMIT](#limit)\n- [CREATE](#create)\n- [MERGE](#merge)\n- [DELETE](#delete)\n- [SET](#set)\n- [WITH](#with)\n- [UNION](#union)\n- [UNWIND](#unwind)\n- [FOREACH](#foreach)\n\n#### MATCH\n\nMatch describes the relationship between queried entities, using ascii art to represent pattern(s) to match against.\n\nNodes are represented by parentheses `()`, and Relationships are represented by brackets `[]`.\n\nEach graph entity node/relationship can contain an alias and a label/relationship type, but both can be left empty if necessary.\n\nEntity structure: `alias:label {filters}`.\n\nAlias, label/relationship type, and filters are all optional.\n\nExample:\n\n``` chroma\n(a:Actor)-[:ACT]->(m:Movie {title:\"straight outta compton\"})\n```\n\n`a` is an alias for the source node, which we'll be able to refer to at different places within our query.\n\n`Actor` is the label under which this node is marked.\n\n`ACT` is the relationship type.\n\n`m` is an alias for the destination node.\n\n`Movie` destination node is of \"type\" movie.\n\n`{title:\"straight outta compton\"}` requires the node's title attribute to equal \"straight outta compton\".\n\nIn this example, we're interested in actor entities which have the relation \"act\" with **the** entity representing the \"straight outta compton\" movie.\n\nIt is possible to describe broader relationships by composing a multi-hop query such as:\n\n``` chroma\n(me {name:'swilly'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->()-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(foaf)\n```\n\nHere we're interested in finding out who my friends' friends are.\n\nNodes can have more than one relationship coming in or out of them, for instance:\n\n``` chroma\n(me {name:'swilly'})-[:VISITED]->(c:Country)<-[:VISITED]-(friend)<-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(me)\n```\n\nHere we're interested in knowing which of my friends have visited at least one country I've been to.\n\n##### Variable length relationships\n\nNodes that are a variable number of relationship→node hops away can be found using the following syntax:\n\n``` chroma\n-[:TYPE*minHops..maxHops]->\n```\n\n[`TYPE`](../type), `minHops` and `maxHops` are all optional and default to type agnostic, 1 and infinity, respectively.\n\nWhen no bounds are given the dots may be omitted. The dots may also be omitted when setting only one bound and this implies a fixed length pattern.\n\nExample:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (charlie:Actor { name: 'Charlie Sheen' })-[:PLAYED_WITH*1..3]->(colleague:Actor)\nRETURN colleague\"\n```\n\nReturns all actors related to 'Charlie Sheen' by 1 to 3 hops.\n\n##### Bidirectional path traversal\n\nIf a relationship pattern does not specify a direction, it will match regardless of which node is the source and which is the destination:\n\n``` chroma\n-[:TYPE]-\n```\n\nExample:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (person_a:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(person_b:Person)\nRETURN person_a, person_b\"\n```\n\nReturns all pairs of people connected by a `KNOWS` relationship. Note that each pair will be returned twice, once with each node in the `person_a` field and once in the `person_b` field.\n\nThe syntactic sugar `(person_a)<-[:KNOWS]->(person_b)` will return the same results.\n\nThe bracketed edge description can be omitted if all relations should be considered: `(person_a)--(person_b)`.\n\n##### Named paths\n\nNamed path variables are created by assigning a path in a MATCH clause to a single alias with the syntax: `MATCH named_path = (path)-[to]->(capture)`\n\nThe named path includes all entities in the path, regardless of whether they have been explicitly aliased. Named paths can be accessed using [designated built-in functions](#path-functions) or returned directly if using a language-specific client.\n\nExample:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH p=(charlie:Actor { name: 'Charlie Sheen' })-[:PLAYED_WITH*1..3]->(:Actor)\nRETURN nodes(p) as actors\"\n```\n\nThis query will produce all the paths matching the pattern contained in the named path `p`. All of these paths will share the same starting point, the actor node representing Charlie Sheen, but will otherwise vary in length and contents. Though the variable-length traversal and `(:Actor)` endpoint are not explicitly aliased, all nodes and edges traversed along the path will be included in `p`. In this case, we are only interested in the nodes of each path, which we'll collect using the built-in function `nodes()`. The returned value will contain, in order, Charlie Sheen, between 0 and 2 intermediate nodes, and the unaliased endpoint.\n\n##### All shortest paths\n\nThe `allShortestPaths` function returns all the shortest paths between a pair of entities.\n\n`allShortestPaths()` is a MATCH mode in which only the shortest paths matching all criteria are captured. Both the source and the target nodes must be bound in an earlier WITH-demarcated scope to invoke `allShortestPaths()`.\n\nA minimal length (must be 1) and maximal length (must be at least 1) for the search may be specified. Zero or more relationship types may be specified (e.g. \\[:R\\|Q\\*1..3\\]). No property filters may be introduced in the pattern.\n\n`allShortestPaths()` can have any number of hops for its minimum and maximum, including zero. This number represents how many edges can be traversed in fulfilling the pattern, with a value of 0 entailing that the source node will be included in the returned path.\n\nFilters on properties are supported, and any number of labels may be specified.\n\nExample:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (charlie:Actor {name: 'Charlie Sheen'}), (kevin:Actor {name: 'Kevin Bacon'})\nWITH charlie, kevin\nMATCH p=allShortestPaths((charlie)-[:PLAYED_WITH*]->(kevin))\nRETURN nodes(p) as actors\"\n```\n\nThis query will produce all paths of the minimum length connecting the actor node representing Charlie Sheen to the one representing Kevin Bacon. There are several 2-hop paths between the two actors, and all of these will be returned. The computation of paths then terminates, as we are not interested in any paths of length greater than 2.\n\n##### Single-Pair minimal-weight bounded-cost bounded-length paths\n\n(Since RedisGraph v2.10)\n\nThe `algo.SPpaths` procedure returns one, *n*, or all minimal-weight, \\[optionally\\] bounded-cost, \\[optionally\\] bounded-length distinct paths between a pair of entities. Each path is a sequence of distinct nodes connected by distinct edges.\n\n`algo.SPpaths()` is a MATCH mode in which only the paths matching all criteria are captured. Both the source and the target nodes must be bound in an earlier WITH-demarcated scope to invoke `algo.SPpaths()`.\n\nInput arguments:\n\n- A map containing:\n  - `sourceNode`: Mandatory.

Paths with identical vertices and different edges are different paths. The following are 3 different paths ('n1', 'n2', and 'n3' are nodes; 'e1', 'e2', 'e3', and 'e4' are edges): (n1)-\\[e1\\]-(n2)-\\[e2\\]-(n3), (n1)-\\[e1\\]-(n2)-\\[e3\\]-(n3), (n1)-\\[e4\\]-(n2)-\\[e3\\]-(n3)\n\nExample:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \n\"MATCH (s:Actor {name: 'Charlie Sheen'})\nCALL algo.SSpaths( {sourceNode: s, relTypes: ['r1', 'r2', 'r3'], relDirection: 'outgoing', pathCount: 1, weightProp: 'weight', costProp: 'cost', maxLen: 3, maxCost: 100} ) \nYIELD path, pathCost, pathWeight\nRETURN path ORDER BY pathCost\"\n```\n\n#### OPTIONAL MATCH\n\nThe OPTIONAL MATCH clause is a MATCH variant that produces null values for elements that do not match successfully, rather than the all-or-nothing logic for patterns in MATCH clauses.\n\nIt can be considered to fill the same role as LEFT/RIGHT JOIN does in SQL, as MATCH entities must be resolved but nodes and edges introduced in OPTIONAL MATCH will be returned as nulls if they cannot be found.\n\nOPTIONAL MATCH clauses accept the same patterns as standard MATCH clauses, and may similarly be modified by WHERE clauses.\n\nMultiple MATCH and OPTIONAL MATCH clauses can be chained together, though a mandatory MATCH cannot follow an optional one.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (p:Person) OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[w:WORKS_AT]->(c:Company)\nWHERE w.start_date > 2016\nRETURN p, w, c\"\n```\n\nAll `Person` nodes are returned, as well as any `WORKS_AT` relations and `Company` nodes that can be resolved and satisfy the `start_date` constraint. For each `Person` that does not resolve the optional pattern, the person will be returned as normal and the non-matching elements will be returned as null.\n\nCypher is lenient in its handling of null values, so actions like property accesses and function calls on null values will return null values rather than emit errors.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (p:Person) OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[w:WORKS_AT]->(c:Company)\nRETURN p, w.department, ID(c) as ID\"\n```\n\nIn this case, `w.department` and `ID` will be returned if the OPTIONAL MATCH was successful, and will be null otherwise.\n\nClauses like SET, CREATE, MERGE, and DELETE will ignore null inputs and perform the expected updates on real inputs. One exception to this is that attempting to create a relation with a null endpoint will cause an error:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (p:Person) OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[w:WORKS_AT]->(c:Company)\nCREATE (c)-[:NEW_RELATION]->(:NEW_NODE)\"\n```\n\nIf `c` is null for any record, this query will emit an error. In this case, no changes to the graph are committed, even if some values for `c` were resolved.\n\n#### WHERE\n\nThis clause is not mandatory, but if you want to filter results, you can specify your predicates here.\n\nSupported operations:\n\n- `=`\n- `<>`\n- `<`\n- `<=`\n- `>`\n- `>=`\n- `CONTAINS`\n- `ENDS WITH`\n- `IN`\n- `STARTS WITH`\n\nPredicates can be combined using AND / OR / NOT.\n\nBe sure to wrap predicates within parentheses to control precedence.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nWHERE (actor.name = \"john doe\" OR movie.rating > 8.8) AND movie.votes <= 250)\n```\n\n```\nWHERE actor.age >= director.age AND actor.age > 32\n```\n\nIt is also possible to specify equality predicates within nodes using the curly braces as such:\n\n```\n(:President {name:\"Jed Bartlett\"})-[:WON]->(:State)\n```\n\nHere we've required that the president node's name will have the value \"Jed Bartlett\".\n\nThere's no difference between inline predicates and predicates specified within the WHERE clause.\n\nIt is also possible to filter on graph patterns. The following queries, which return all presidents and the states they won in, produce the same results:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (p:President), (s:State) WHERE (p)-[:WON]->(s) RETURN p, s\n```\n\nand\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (p:President)-[:WON]->(s:State) RETURN p, s\n```\n\nPattern predicates can be also negated and combined with the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT. The following query returns all the presidents that did not win in the states where they were governors:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (p:President), (s:State) WHERE NOT (p)-[:WON]->(s) AND (p)->[:governor]->(s) RETURN p, s\n```\n\nNodes can also be filtered by label:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (n)-[:R]->() WHERE n:L1 OR n:L2 RETURN n \n```\n\nWhen possible, it is preferable to specify the label in the node pattern of the MATCH clause.\n\n#### RETURN\n\nIn its simple form, Return defines which properties the returned result-set will contain.\n\nIts structure is a list of `alias.property` separated by commas.\n\nFor convenience, it's possible to specify the alias only when you're interested in every attribute an entity possesses, and don't want to specify each attribute individually. For example:\n\n``` chroma\nRETURN movie.title, actor\n```\n\nUse the DISTINCT keyword to remove duplications within the result-set:\n\n``` chroma\nRETURN DISTINCT friend_of_friend.name\n```\n\nIn the above example, suppose we have two friends, Joe and Miesha, and both know Dominick.\n\nDISTINCT will make sure Dominick will only appear once in the final result set.\n\nReturn can also be used to aggregate data, similar to group by in SQL.\n\nOnce an aggregation function is added to the return list, all other \"none\" aggregated values are considered as group keys, for example:\n\n``` chroma\nRETURN movie.title, MAX(actor.age), MIN(actor.age)\n```\n\nHere we group data by movie title and for each movie, and we find its youngest and oldest actor age.\n\n#### Aggregations\n\nSupported aggregation functions include:\n\n- `avg`\n- `collect`\n- `count`\n- `max`\n- `min`\n- `percentileCont`\n- `percentileDisc`\n- `stDev`\n- `sum`\n\n#### ORDER BY\n\nOrder by specifies that the output be sorted and how.\n\nYou can order by multiple properties by stating each variable in the ORDER BY clause.\n\nEach property may specify its sort order with `ASC`/`ASCENDING` or `DESC`/`DESCENDING`. If no order is specified, it defaults to ascending.\n\nThe result will be sorted by the first variable listed.\n\nFor equal values, it will go to the next property in the ORDER BY clause, and so on.\n\n``` chroma\nORDER BY <alias.property [ASC/DESC] list>\n```\n\nBelow we sort our friends by height. For equal heights, weight is used to break ties.\n\n``` chroma\nORDER BY friend.height, friend.weight DESC\n```\n\n#### SKIP\n\nThe optional skip clause allows a specified number of records to be omitted from the result set.\n\n``` chroma\nSKIP <number of records to skip>\n```\n\nThis can be useful when processing results in batches. A query that would examine the second 100-element batch of nodes with the label `Person`, for example, would be:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p ORDER BY p.name SKIP 100 LIMIT 100\"\n```\n\n#### LIMIT\n\nAlthough not mandatory, you can use the limit clause to limit the number of records returned by a query:\n\n```\nLIMIT <max records to return>\n```\n\nIf not specified, there's no limit to the number of records returned by a query.\n\n#### CREATE\n\nCREATE is used to introduce new nodes and relationships.\n\nThe simplest example of CREATE would be a single node creation:\n\n``` chroma\nCREATE (n)\n```\n\nIt's possible to create multiple entities by separating them with a comma.\n\n``` chroma\nCREATE (n),(m)\n```\n\n``` chroma\nCREATE (:Person {name: 'Kurt', age: 27})\n```\n\nTo add relations between nodes, in the following example we first find an existing source node. After it's found, we create a new relationship and destination node.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (a:Person)\nWHERE a.name = 'Kurt'\nCREATE (a)-[:MEMBER]->(:Band {name:'Nirvana'})\"\n```\n\nHere the source node is a bounded node, while the destination node is unbounded.\n\nAs a result, a new node is created representing the band Nirvana and a new relation connects Kurt to the band.\n\nLastly we create a complete pattern.\n\nAll entities within the pattern which are not bounded will be created.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"CREATE (jim:Person{name:'Jim', age:29})-[:FRIENDS]->(pam:Person {name:'Pam', age:27})-[:WORKS]->(:Employer {name:'Dunder Mifflin'})\"\n```\n\nThis query will create three nodes and two relationships.\n\n#### DELETE\n\nDELETE is used to remove both nodes and relationships.\n\nNote that deleting a node also deletes all of its incoming and outgoing relationships.\n\nTo delete a node and all of its relationships:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MATCH (p:Person {name:'Jim'}) DELETE p\"\n```\n\nTo delete relationship:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MATCH (:Person {name:'Jim'})-[r:FRIENDS]->() DELETE r\"\n```\n\nThis query will delete all `friend` outgoing relationships from the node with the name 'Jim'.\n\n#### SET\n\nSET is used to create or update properties on nodes and relationships.\n\nTo set a property on a node, use [`SET`](../set).\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MATCH (n { name: 'Jim' }) SET n.name = 'Bob'\"\n```\n\nIf you want to set multiple properties in one go, simply separate them with a comma to set multiple properties using a single SET clause.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (n { name: 'Jim', age:32 })\nSET n.age = 33, n.name = 'Bob'\"\n```\n\nThe same can be accomplished by setting the graph entity variable to a map:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (n { name: 'Jim', age:32 })\nSET n = {age: 33, name: 'Bob'}\"\n```\n\nUsing `=` in this way replaces all of the entity's previous properties, while `+=` will only set the properties it explicitly mentions.\n\nIn the same way, the full property set of a graph entity can be assigned or merged:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (jim {name: 'Jim'}), (pam {name: 'Pam'})\nSET jim = pam\"\n```\n\nAfter executing this query, the `jim` node will have the same property set as the `pam` node.\n\nTo remove a node's property, simply set property value to NULL.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MATCH (n { name: 'Jim' }) SET n.name = NULL\"\n```\n\n#### MERGE\n\nThe MERGE clause ensures that a path exists in the graph (either the path already exists, or it needs to be created).\n\nMERGE either matches existing nodes and binds them, or it creates new data and binds that.\n\nIt’s like a combination of MATCH and CREATE that also allows you to specify what happens if the data was matched or created.\n\nFor example, you can specify that the graph must contain a node for a user with a certain name.\n\nIf there isn’t a node with the correct name, a new node will be created and its name property set.\n\nAny aliases in the MERGE path that were introduced by earlier clauses can only be matched; MERGE will not create them.\n\nWhen the MERGE path doesn't rely on earlier clauses, the whole path will always either be matched or created.\n\nIf all path elements are introduced by MERGE, a match failure will cause all elements to be created, even if part of the match succeeded.\n\nThe MERGE path can be followed by ON MATCH SET and ON CREATE SET directives to conditionally set properties depending on whether or not the match succeeded.\n\n**Merging nodes**\n\nTo merge a single node with a label:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MERGE (robert:Critic)\"\n```\n\nTo merge a single node with properties:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MERGE (charlie { name: 'Charlie Sheen', age: 10 })\"\n```\n\nTo merge a single node, specifying both label and property:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"MERGE (michael:Person { name: 'Michael Douglas' })\"\n```\n\n**Merging paths**\n\nBecause MERGE either matches or creates a full path, it is easy to accidentally create duplicate nodes.\n\nFor example, if we run the following query on our sample graph:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MERGE (charlie { name: 'Charlie Sheen '})-[r:ACTED_IN]->(wallStreet:Movie { name: 'Wall Street' })\"\n```\n\nEven though a node with the name 'Charlie Sheen' already exists, the full pattern does not match, so 1 relation and 2 nodes - including a duplicate 'Charlie Sheen' node - will be created.\n\nWe should use multiple MERGE clauses to merge a relation and only create non-existent endpoints:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MERGE (charlie { name: 'Charlie Sheen' })\n MERGE (wallStreet:Movie { name: 'Wall Street' })\n MERGE (charlie)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(wallStreet)\"\n```\n\nIf we don't want to create anything if pattern elements don't exist, we can combine MATCH and MERGE clauses. The following query merges a relation only if both of its endpoints already exist:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (charlie { name: 'Charlie Sheen' })\n MATCH (wallStreet:Movie { name: 'Wall Street' })\n MERGE (charlie)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(wallStreet)\"\n```\n\n**On Match and On Create directives**\n\nUsing ON MATCH and ON CREATE, MERGE can set properties differently depending on whether a pattern is matched or created.\n\nIn this query, we'll merge paths based on a list of properties and conditionally set a property when creating new entities:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"UNWIND ['Charlie Sheen', 'Michael Douglas', 'Tamara Tunie'] AS actor_name\n MATCH (movie:Movie { name: 'Wall Street' })\n MERGE (person {name: actor_name})-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie)\n ON CREATE SET person.first_role = movie.name\"\n```\n\n#### WITH\n\nThe WITH clause allows parts of queries to be independently executed and have their results handled uniquely.\n\nThis allows for more flexible query composition as well as data manipulations that would otherwise not be possible in a single query.\n\nIf, for example, we wanted to find all children in our graph who are above the average age of all people:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (p:Person) WITH AVG(p.age) AS average_age MATCH (:Person)-[:PARENT_OF]->(child:Person) WHERE child.age > average_age return child\n```\n\nThis also allows us to use modifiers like `DISTINCT`, `SKIP`, `LIMIT`, and `ORDER` that otherwise require `RETURN` clauses.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (u:User)  WITH u AS nonrecent ORDER BY u.lastVisit LIMIT 3 SET nonrecent.should_contact = true\"\n```\n\n#### UNWIND\n\nThe UNWIND clause breaks down a given list into a sequence of records; each contains a single element in the list.\n\nThe order of the records preserves the original list order.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"CREATE (p {array:[1,2,3]})\"\n```\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (p) UNWIND p.array AS y RETURN y\"\n```\n\n#### FOREACH\n\n(Since RedisGraph v2.12)\n\nThe `FOREACH` clause feeds the components of a list to a sub-query comprised of **updating clauses only** (`CREATE`, `MERGE`, [`SET`](../set), `REMOVE`, `DELETE` and `FOREACH`), while passing on the records it receives without change.\n\nThe clauses within the sub-query recognize the bound variables defined prior to the `FOREACH` clause, but are local in the sense that later clauses are not aware of the variables defined inside them. In other words, `FOREACH` uses the current context, and does not affect it.\n\nThe `FOREACH` clause can be used for numerous purposes, such as: Updating and creating graph entities in a concise manner, marking nodes\\edges that satisfy some condition or are part of a path of interest and performing conditional queries.\n\nWe show examples of queries performing the above 3 use-cases.\n\nThe following query will create 5 nodes, each with property `v` with the values from 0 to 4 corresponding to the appropriate index in the list.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"FOREACH(i in [1, 2, 3, 4] | CREATE (n:N {v: i}))\"\n```\n\nThe following query marks the nodes of all paths of length up to 15 km from a hotel in Toronto to a steakhouse with at least 2 Michelin stars.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH p = (hotel:HOTEL {City: 'Toronto'})-[r:ROAD*..5]->(rest:RESTAURANT {type: 'Steakhouse'}) WHERE sum(r.length) <= 15 AND hotel.stars >= 4 AND rest.Michelin_stars >= 2\nFOREACH(n in nodes(p) | SET n.part_of_path = true)\"\n```\n\nThe following query searches for all the hotels, checks whether they buy directly from a bakery, and if not - makes sure they are marked as buying from a supplier that supplies bread, and that they do not buy directly from a bakery.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (h:HOTEL) OPTIONAL MATCH (h)-[b:BUYS_FROM]->(bakery:BAKERY)\nFOREACH(do_perform IN CASE WHEN b = NULL THEN [1] ELSE [] END | MERGE (h)-[b2:BUYS_FROM]->(s:SUPPLIER {supplies_bread: true}) SET b2.direct = false)\"\n```\n\n#### UNION\n\nThe UNION clause is used to combine the result of multiple queries.\n\nUNION combines the results of two or more queries into a single result set that includes all the rows that belong to all queries in the union.\n\nThe number and the names of the columns must be identical in all queries combined by using UNION.\n\nTo keep all the result rows, use UNION ALL.\n\nUsing just UNION will combine and remove duplicates from the result set.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (n:Actor) RETURN n.name AS name\nUNION ALL\nMATCH (n:Movie) RETURN n.title AS name\"\n```\n\n###

In Cypher, they use the syntax:\n\n``` chroma\n[element IN array WHERE condition | output elem]\n```\n\n- `array` can be any expression that produces an array: a literal, a property reference, or a function call.\n- `WHERE condition` is an optional argument to only project elements that pass a certain criteria. If omitted, all elements in the array will be represented in the output.\n- `| output elem` is an optional argument that allows elements to be transformed in the output array. If omitted, the output elements will be the same as their corresponding inputs.\n\nThe following query collects all paths of any length, then for each produces an array containing the `name` property of every node with a `rank` property greater than 10:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH p=()-[*]->() RETURN [node IN nodes(p) WHERE node.rank > 10 | node.name]\n```\n\n#### Existential comprehension functions\n\nThe functions `any()`, `all()`, `single()` and `none()` use a simplified form of the list comprehension syntax and return a boolean value.\n\n``` chroma\nany(element IN array WHERE condition)\n```\n\nThey can operate on any form of input array, but are particularly useful for path filtering. The following query collects all paths of any length in which all traversed edges have a weight less than 3:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH p=()-[*]->() WHERE all(edge IN relationships(p) WHERE edge.weight < 3) RETURN p\n```\n\n### Pattern comprehensions\n\nPattern comprehensions are a method of producing a list composed of values found by performing the traversal of a given graph pattern.\n\nThe following query returns the name of a `Person` node and a list of all their friends' ages:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (n:Person)\nRETURN\nn.name,\n[(n)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(f:Person) | f.age]\n```\n\nOptionally, a `WHERE` clause may be embedded in the pattern comprehension to filter results. In this query, all friends' ages will be gathered for friendships that started before 2010:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (n:Person)\nRETURN\nn.name,\n[(n)-[e:FRIEND_OF]->(f:Person) WHERE e.since < 2010 | f.age]\n```\n\n### CASE WHEN\n\nThe case statement comes in two variants. Both accept an input argument and evaluates it against one or more expressions. The first `WHEN` argument that specifies a value matching the result will be accepted, and the value specified by the corresponding `THEN` keyword will be returned.\n\nOptionally, an `ELSE` argument may also be specified to indicate what to do if none of the `WHEN` arguments match successfully.\n\nIn its simple form, there is only one expression to evaluate and it immediately follows the `CASE` keyword:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (n)\nRETURN\nCASE n.title\nWHEN 'Engineer' THEN 100\nWHEN 'Scientist' THEN 80\nELSE n.privileges\nEND\n```\n\nIn its generic form, no expression follows the `CASE` keyword. Instead, each `WHEN` statement specifies its own expression:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (n)\nRETURN\nCASE\nWHEN n.age < 18 THEN '0-18'\nWHEN n.age < 30 THEN '18-30'\nELSE '30+'\nEND\n```\n\n#### Reduce\n\nThe `reduce()` function accepts a starting value and updates it by evaluating an expression against each element of the list:\n\n``` chroma\nRETURN reduce(sum = 0, n IN [1,2,3] | sum + n)\n```\n\n`sum` will successively have the values 0, 1, 3, and 6, with 6 being the output of the function call.\n\n### Point\n\nThe `point()` function expects one map argument of the form:\n\n``` chroma\nRETURN point({latitude: lat_value, longitude: lon_val})\n```\n\nThe key names `latitude` and `longitude` are case-sensitive.\n\nThe point constructed by this function can be saved as a node/relationship property or used within the query, such as in a `distance` function call.\n\n### shortestPath\n\nThe `shortestPath()` function is invoked with the form:\n\n``` chroma\nMATCH (a {v: 1}), (b {v: 4}) RETURN shortestPath((a)-[:L*]->(b))\n```\n\nThe sole `shortestPath` argument is a traversal pattern. This pattern's endpoints must be resolved prior to the function call, and no property filters may be introduced in the pattern. The relationship pattern may specify any number of relationship types (including zero) to be considered. If a minimum number of edges to traverse is specified, it may only be 0 or 1, while any number may be used for the maximum. If 0 is specified as the minimum, the source node will be included in the returned path. If no shortest path can be found, NULL is returned.\n\n### JSON format\n\n`toJSON()` returns the input value in JSON formatting. For primitive data types and arrays, this conversion is conventional. Maps and map projections (`toJSON(node { .prop} )`) are converted to JSON objects, as are nodes and relationships.\n\nThe format for a node object in JSON is:\n\n``` chroma\n{\n  \"type\": \"node\",\n  \"id\": id(int),\n  \"labels\": [label(string) X N],\n  \"properties\": {\n    property_key(string): property_value X N\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe format for a relationship object in JSON is:\n\n``` chroma\n{\n  \"type\": \"relationship\",\n  \"id\": id(int),\n  \"relationship\": type(string),\n  \"properties\": {\n    property_key(string): property_value X N\n  }\n  \"start\": src_node(node),\n  \"end\": dest_node(node)\n}\n```\n\n## Procedures\n\nProcedures are invoked using the syntax:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY social \"CALL db.labels()\"\n```\n\nOr the variant:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY social \"CALL db.labels() YIELD label\"\n```\n\nYIELD modifiers are only required if explicitly specified; by default the value in the 'Yields' column will be emitted automatically.\n\n| Procedure                       | Arguments                                       | Yields                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| db.labels                       | none                                            | `label`                                                                      | Yields all node labels in the graph.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| db.relationshipTypes            | none                                            | `relationshipType`                                                           | Yields all relationship types in the graph.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| db.propertyKeys                 | none                                            | `propertyKey`                                                                | Yields all property keys in the graph.                                                                                                                                                       |\n| db.indexes                      | none                                            | `type`, `label`, `properties`, `language`, `stopwords`, `entitytype`, `info` | Yield all indexes in the graph, denoting whether they are exact-match or full-text and which label and properties each covers and whether they are indexing node or relationship attributes. |\n| db.constraints                  | none                                            | `type`, `label`, `properties`, `entitytype`, `status`                        | Yield all constraints in the graph, denoting constraint type (UNIQIE/MANDATORY), which label/relationship-type and properties each enforces.                                                 |\n| db.idx.fulltext.createNodeIndex | `label`, `property` \\[, `property` ...\\]        | none                                                                         | Builds a full-text searchable index on a label and the 1 or more specified properties.                                                                                                       |\n| db.idx.fulltext.drop            | `label`                                         | none                                                                         | Deletes the full-text index associated with the given label.                                                                                                                                 |\n| db.idx.fulltext.queryNodes      | `label`, `string`                               | `node`, `score`                                                              | Retrieve all nodes that contain the specified string in the full-text indexes on the given label.                                                                                            |\n| algo.pageRank                   | `label`, `relationship-type`                    | `node`, `score`                                                              | Runs the pagerank algorithm over nodes of given label, considering only edges of given relationship type.                                                                                    |\n| [algo.BFS](#BFS)                | `source-node`, `max-level`, `relationship-type` | `nodes`, `edges`                                                             | Performs BFS to find all nodes connected to the source.

Otherwise, it specifies a single relationship type to perform BFS over.\n\nIt can yield two outputs:\n\n`nodes` - An array of all nodes connected to the source without violating the input constraints.\n\n`edges` - An array of all edges traversed during the search. This does not necessarily contain all edges connecting nodes in the tree, as cycles or multiple edges connecting the same source and destination do not have a bearing on the reachability this algorithm tests for. These can be used to construct the directed acyclic graph that represents the BFS tree. Emitting edges incurs a small performance penalty.\n\n## Indexing\n\nRedisGraph supports single-property indexes for node labels and for relationship type. String, numeric, and geospatial data types can be indexed.\n\n### Creating an index for a node label\n\nFor a node label, the index creation syntax is:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CREATE INDEX FOR (p:Person) ON (p.age)\"\n```\n\nAn old syntax is also supported:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CREATE INDEX ON :Person(age)\"\n```\n\nAfter an index is explicitly created, it will automatically be used by queries that reference that label and any indexed property in a filter.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.EXPLAIN DEMO_GRAPH \"MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age > 80 RETURN p\"\n1) \"Results\"\n2) \"    Project\"\n3) \"        Index Scan | (p:Person)\"\n```\n\nThis can significantly improve the runtime of queries with very specific filters. An index on `:employer(name)`, for example, will dramatically benefit the query:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"MATCH (:Employer {name: 'Dunder Mifflin'})-[:EMPLOYS]->(p:Person) RETURN p\"\n```\n\nAn example of utilizing a geospatial index to find `Employer` nodes within 5 kilometers of Scranton is:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"WITH point({latitude:41.4045886, longitude:-75.6969532}) AS scranton MATCH (e:Employer) WHERE distance(e.location, scranton) < 5000 RETURN e\"\n```\n\nGeospatial indexes can currently only be leveraged with `<` and `<=` filters; matching nodes outside of the given radius is performed using conventional matching.\n\n### Creating an index for a relationship type\n\nFor a relationship type, the index creation syntax is:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CREATE INDEX FOR ()-[f:FOLLOW]-() ON (f.created_at)\"\n```\n\nThen the execution plan for using the index:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.EXPLAIN DEMO_GRAPH \"MATCH (p:Person {id: 0})-[f:FOLLOW]->(fp) WHERE 0 < f.created_at AND f.created_at < 1000 RETURN fp\"\n1) \"Results\"\n2) \"    Project\"\n3) \"        Edge By Index Scan | [f:FOLLOW]\"\n4) \"            Node By Index Scan | (p:Person)\"\n```\n\nThis can significantly improve the runtime of queries that traverse super nodes or when we want to start traverse from relationships.\n\n### Deleting an index for a node label\n\nFor a node label, the index deletion syntax is:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"DROP INDEX ON :Person(age)\"\n```\n\n### Deleting an index for a relationship type\n\nFor a relationship type, the index deletion syntax is:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"DROP INDEX ON :FOLLOW(created_at)\"\n```\n\n## Full-text indexing\n\nRedisGraph leverages the indexing capabilities of [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/index.html) to provide full-text indices through procedure calls.\n\n### Creating a full-text index for a node label\n\nTo construct a full-text index on the `title` property of all nodes with label `Movie`, use the syntax:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CALL db.idx.fulltext.createNodeIndex('Movie', 'title')\"\n```\n\nMore properties can be added to this index by adding their names to the above set of arguments, or using this syntax again with the additional names.\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CALL db.idx.fulltext.createNodeIndex('Person', 'firstName', 'lastName')\"\n```\n\nRediSearch provide 2 index configuration options:\n\n1.  Language - Define which language to use for stemming text which is adding the base form of a word to the index. This allows the query for \"going\" to also return results for \"go\" and \"gone\", for example.\n2.  Stopwords - These are words that are usually so common that they do not add much information to search, but take up a lot of space and CPU time in the index.\n\nTo construct a full-text index on the `title` property using `German` language and using custom stopwords of all nodes with label `Movie`, use the syntax:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CALL db.idx.fulltext.createNodeIndex({ label: 'Movie', language: 'German', stopwords: ['a', 'ab'] }, 'title')\"\n```\n\nRediSearch provide 3 additional field configuration options:\n\n1.  Weight - The importance of the text in the field\n2.  Nostem - Skip stemming when indexing text\n3.  Phonetic - Enable phonetic search on the text\n\nTo construct a full-text index on the `title` property with phonetic search of all nodes with label `Movie`, use the syntax:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CALL db.idx.fulltext.createNodeIndex('Movie', {field: 'title', phonetic: 'dm:en'})\"\n```\n\n### Utilizing a full-text index for a node label\n\nAn index can be invoked to match any whole words contained within:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"CALL db.idx.fulltext.queryNodes('Movie', 'Book') YIELD node RETURN node.title\"\n1) 1) \"node.title\"\n2) 1) 1) \"The Jungle Book\"\n   2) 1) \"The Book of Life\"\n3) 1) \"Query internal execution time: 0.927409 milliseconds\"\n```\n\nThis CALL clause can be interleaved with other Cypher clauses to perform more elaborate manipulations:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"CALL db.idx.fulltext.queryNodes('Movie', 'Book') YIELD node AS m\nWHERE m.genre = 'Adventure'\nRETURN m ORDER BY m.rating\"\n1) 1) \"m\"\n2) 1) 1) 1) 1) \"id\"\n            2) (integer) 1168\n         2) 1) \"labels\"\n            2) 1) \"Movie\"\n         3) 1) \"properties\"\n            2) 1) 1) \"genre\"\n                  2) \"Adventure\"\n               2) 1) \"rating\"\n                  2) \"7.6\"\n               3) 1) \"votes\"\n                  2) (integer) 151342\n               4) 1) \"year\"\n                  2) (integer) 2016\n               5) 1) \"title\"\n                  2) \"The Jungle Book\"\n3) 1) \"Query internal execution time: 0.226914 milliseconds\"\n```\n\nIn addition to yielding matching nodes, full-text index scans will return the score of each node. This is the [TF-IDF](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/scoring/#tfidf-default) score of the node, which is informed by how many times the search terms appear in the node and how closely grouped they are. This can be observed in the example:\n\n``` chroma\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH\n\"CALL db.idx.fulltext.queryNodes('Node', 'hello world') YIELD node, score RETURN score, node.val\"\n1) 1) \"score\"\n   2) \"node.val\"\n2) 1) 1) \"2\"\n      2) \"hello world\"\n   2) 1) \"1\"\n      2) \"hello to a different world\"\n3) 1) \"Cached execution: 1\"\n   2) \"Query internal execution time: 0.335401 milliseconds\"\n```\n\n### Deleting a full-text index for a node label\n\nFor a node label, the full-text index deletion syntax is:\n\n```\nGRAPH.QUERY DEMO_GRAPH \"CALL db.idx.fulltext.drop('Movie')\"\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/graph.query/](https://redis.io/commands/graph.query/)"

  summary: Switch to a different protocol, optionally authenticating and setting the connection's name, or provide a contextual client report
  description: "# HELLO\n\n    HELLO\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nHELLO [protover [AUTH username password] [SETNAME clientname]]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n6.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@fast`, `@connection`,\n\nSwitch to a different protocol, optionally authenticating and setting the connection's name, or provide a contextual client report.\n\nRedis version 6 and above supports two protocols: the old protocol, RESP2, and a new one introduced with Redis 6, RESP3. RESP3 has certain advantages since when the connection is in this mode, Redis is able to reply with more semantical replies: for instance, [`HGETALL`](../hgetall) will return a *map type*, so a client library implementation no longer requires to know in advance to translate the array into a hash before returning it to the caller. For a full coverage of RESP3, please check the [RESP3 specification](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md).\n\nIn Redis 6 connections start in RESP2 mode, so clients implementing RESP2 do not need to updated or changed. There are no short term plans to drop support for RESP2, although future version may default to RESP3.\n\n`HELLO` always replies with a list of current server and connection properties, such as: versions, modules loaded, client ID, replication role and so forth. When called without any arguments in Redis 6.2 and its default use of RESP2 protocol, the reply looks like this:\n\n    > HELLO\n     1) \"server\"\n     2) \"redis\"\n     3) \"version\"\n     4) \"255.255.255\"\n     5) \"proto\"\n     6) (integer) 2\n     7) \"id\"\n     8) (integer) 5\n     9) \"mode\"\n    10) \"standalone\"\n    11) \"role\"\n    12) \"master\"\n    13) \"modules\"\n    14) (empty array)\n\nClients that want to handshake using the RESP3 mode need to call the `HELLO` command and specify the value \"3\" as the `protover` argument, like so:\n\n    > HELLO 3\n    1# \"server\" => \"redis\"\n    2# \"version\" => \"6.0.0\"\n    3# \"proto\" => (integer) 3\n    4# \"id\" => (integer) 10\n    5# \"mode\" => \"standalone\"\n    6# \"role\" => \"master\"\n    7# \"modules\" => (empty array)\n\nBecause `HELLO` replies with useful information, and given that `protover` is optional or can be set to \"2\", client library authors may consider using this command instead of the canonical [`PING`](../ping) when setting up the connection.\n\nWhen called with the optional `protover` argument, this command switches the protocol to the specified version and also accepts the following options:\n\n- `AUTH <username> <password>`: directly authenticate the connection in addition to switching to the specified protocol version. This makes calling [`AUTH`](../auth) before `HELLO` unnecessary when setting up a new connection. Note that the `username` can be set to \"default\" to authenticate against a server that does not use ACLs, but rather the simpler `requirepass` mechanism of Redis prior to version 6.\n- `SETNAME <clientname>`: this is the equivalent of calling [`CLIENT SETNAME`](../client-setname).\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): a list of server properties. The reply is a map instead of an array when RESP3 is selected. The command returns an error if the `protover` requested does not exist.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: `protover` made optional; when called without arguments the command reports the current connection's context.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/hello/](https://redis.io/commands/hello/)"

  description: "# INCR\n\n    INCR\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nINCR key\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n1.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@string`, `@fast`,\n\nIncrements the number stored at `key` by one. If the key does not exist, it is set to `0` before performing the operation. An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a string that can not be represented as integer. This operation is limited to 64 bit signed integers.\n\n**Note**: this is a string operation because Redis does not have a dedicated integer type. The string stored at the key is interpreted as a base-10 **64 bit signed integer** to execute the operation.\n\nRedis stores integers in their integer representation, so for string values that actually hold an integer, there is no overhead for storing the string representation of the integer.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): the value of `key` after the increment\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nSET mykey \"10\"\nINCR mykey\nGET mykey\n```\n\n## Pattern: Counter\n\nThe counter pattern is the most obvious thing you can do with Redis atomic increment operations. The idea is simply send an `INCR` command to Redis every time an operation occurs. For instance in a web application we may want to know how many page views this user did every day of the year.\n\nTo do so the web application may simply increment a key every time the user performs a page view, creating the key name concatenating the User ID and a string representing the current date.\n\nThis simple pattern can be extended in many ways:\n\n- It is possible to use `INCR` and [`EXPIRE`](../expire) together at every page view to have a counter counting only the latest N page views separated by less than the specified amount of seconds.\n- A client may use GETSET in order to atomically get the current counter value and reset it to zero.\n- Using other atomic increment/decrement commands like [`DECR`](../decr) or [`INCRBY`](../incrby) it is possible to handle values that may get bigger or smaller depending on the operations performed by the user. Imagine for instance the score of different users in an online game.\n\n## Pattern: Rate limiter\n\nThe rate limiter pattern is a special counter that is used to limit the rate at which an operation can be performed. The classical materialization of this pattern involves limiting the number of requests that can be performed against a public API.\n\nWe provide two implementations of this pattern using `INCR`, where we assume that the problem to solve is limiting the number of API calls to a maximum of *ten requests per second per IP address*.\n\n## Pattern: Rate limiter 1\n\nThe more simple and direct implementation of this pattern is the following:\n\n```\nFUNCTION LIMIT_API_CALL(ip)\nts = CURRENT_UNIX_TIME()\nkeyname = ip+\":\"+ts\nMULTI\n    INCR(keyname)\n    EXPIRE(keyname,10)\nEXEC\ncurrent = RESPONSE_OF_INCR_WITHIN_MULTI\nIF current > 10 THEN\n    ERROR \"too many requests per second\"\nELSE\n    PERFORM_API_CALL()\nEND\n```\n\nBasically we have a counter for every IP, for every different second. But this counters are always incremented setting an expire of 10 seconds so that they'll be removed by Redis automatically when the current second is a different one.\n\nNote the used of [`MULTI`](../multi) and [`EXEC`](../exec) in order to make sure that we'll both increment and set the expire at every API call.\n\n## Pattern: Rate limiter 2\n\nAn alternative implementation uses a single counter, but is a bit more complex to get it right without race conditions. We'll examine different variants.\n\n```\nFUNCTION LIMIT_API_CALL(ip):\ncurrent = GET(ip)\nIF current != NULL AND current > 10 THEN\n    ERROR \"too many requests per second\"\nELSE\n    value = INCR(ip)\n    IF value == 1 THEN\n        EXPIRE(ip,1)\n    END\n    PERFORM_API_CALL()\nEND\n```\n\nThe counter is created in a way that it only will survive one second, starting from the first request performed in the current second. If there are more than 10 requests in the same second the counter will reach a value greater than 10, otherwise it will expire and start again from 0.\n\n**In the above code there is a race condition**. If for some reason the client performs the `INCR` command but does not perform the [`EXPIRE`](../expire) the key will be leaked until we'll see the same IP address again.\n\nThis can be fixed easily turning the `INCR` with optional [`EXPIRE`](../expire) into a Lua script that is send using the [`EVAL`](../eval) command (only available since Redis version 2.6).\n\n```\nlocal current\ncurrent = redis.call(\"incr\",KEYS[1])\nif current == 1 then\n    redis.call(\"expire\",KEYS[1],1)\nend\n```\n\nThere is a different way to fix this issue without using scripting, by using Redis lists instead of counters. The implementation is more complex and uses more advanced features but has the advantage of remembering the IP addresses of the clients currently performing an API call, that may be useful or not depending on the application.\n\n```\nFUNCTION LIMIT_API_CALL(ip)\ncurrent = LLEN(ip)\nIF current > 10 THEN\n    ERROR \"too many requests per second\"\nELSE\n    IF EXISTS(ip) == FALSE\n        MULTI\n            RPUSH(ip,ip)\n            EXPIRE(ip,1)\n        EXEC\n    ELSE\n        RPUSHX(ip,ip)\n    END\n    PERFORM_API_CALL()\nEND\n```\n\nThe [`RPUSHX`](../rpushx) command only pushes the element if the key already exists.\n\nNote that we have a race here, but it is not a problem: [`EXISTS`](../exists) may return false but the key may be created by another client before we create it inside the [`MULTI`](../multi) / [`EXEC`](../exec) block. However this race will just miss an API call under rare conditions, so the rate limiting will still work correctly.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/incr/](https://redis.io/commands/incr/)"

This field is only present during shutdown.\n\nHere is the meaning of all fields in the **clients** section:\n\n- `connected_clients`: Number of client connections (excluding connections from replicas)\n- `cluster_connections`: An approximation of the number of sockets used by the cluster's bus\n- `maxclients`: The value of the `maxclients` configuration directive. This is the upper limit for the sum of `connected_clients`, `connected_slaves` and `cluster_connections`.\n- `client_recent_max_input_buffer`: Biggest input buffer among current client connections\n- `client_recent_max_output_buffer`: Biggest output buffer among current client connections\n- `blocked_clients`: Number of clients pending on a blocking call ([`BLPOP`](../blpop), [`BRPOP`](../brpop), [`BRPOPLPUSH`](../brpoplpush), [`BLMOVE`](../blmove), [`BZPOPMIN`](../bzpopmin), [`BZPOPMAX`](../bzpopmax))\n- `tracking_clients`: Number of clients being tracked ([`CLIENT TRACKING`](../client-tracking))\n- `clients_in_timeout_table`: Number of clients in the clients timeout table\n\nHere is the meaning of all fields in the **memory** section:\n\n- `used_memory`: Total number of bytes allocated by Redis using its allocator (either standard **libc**, **jemalloc**, or an alternative allocator such as [**tcmalloc**](http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/))\n- `used_memory_human`: Human readable representation of previous value\n- `used_memory_rss`: Number of bytes that Redis allocated as seen by the operating system (a.k.a resident set size). This is the number reported by tools such as `top(1)` and `ps(1)`\n- `used_memory_rss_human`: Human readable representation of previous value\n- `used_memory_peak`: Peak memory consumed by Redis (in bytes)\n- `used_memory_peak_human`: Human readable representation of previous value\n- `used_memory_peak_perc`: The percentage of `used_memory_peak` out of `used_memory`\n- `used_memory_overhead`: The sum in bytes of all overheads that the server allocated for managing its internal data structures\n- `used_memory_startup`: Initial amount of memory consumed by Redis at startup in bytes\n- `used_memory_dataset`: The size in bytes of the dataset (`used_memory_overhead` subtracted from `used_memory`)\n- `used_memory_dataset_perc`: The percentage of `used_memory_dataset` out of the net memory usage (`used_memory` minus `used_memory_startup`)\n- `total_system_memory`: The total amount of memory that the Redis host has\n- `total_system_memory_human`: Human readable representation of previous value\n- `used_memory_lua`: Number of bytes used by the Lua engine\n- `used_memory_lua_human`: Human readable representation of previous value\n- `used_memory_scripts`: Number of bytes used by cached Lua scripts\n- `used_memory_scripts_human`: Human readable representation of previous value\n- `maxmemory`: The value of the `maxmemory` configuration directive\n- `maxmemory_human`: Human readable representation of previous value\n- `maxmemory_policy`: The value of the `maxmemory-policy` configuration directive\n- `mem_fragmentation_ratio`: Ratio between `used_memory_rss` and `used_memory`. Note that this doesn't only includes fragmentation, but also other process overheads (see the `allocator_*` metrics), and also overheads like code, shared libraries, stack, etc.\n- `mem_fragmentation_bytes`: Delta between `used_memory_rss` and `used_memory`. Note that when the total fragmentation bytes is low (few megabytes), a high ratio (e.g. 1.5 and above) is not an indication of an issue.\n- `allocator_frag_ratio:`: Ratio between `allocator_active` and `allocator_allocated`. This is the true (external) fragmentation metric (not `mem_fragmentation_ratio`).\n- `allocator_frag_bytes` Delta between `allocator_active` and `allocator_allocated`. See note about `mem_fragmentation_bytes`.\n- `allocator_rss_ratio`: Ratio between `allocator_resident` and `allocator_active`. This usually indicates pages that the allocator can and probably will soon release back to the OS.\n- `allocator_rss_bytes`: Delta between `allocator_resident` and `allocator_active`\n- `rss_overhead_ratio`: Ratio between `used_memory_rss` (the process RSS) and `allocator_resident`. This includes RSS overheads that are not allocator or heap related.\n- `rss_overhead_bytes`: Delta between `used_memory_rss` (the process RSS) and `allocator_resident`\n- `allocator_allocated`: Total bytes allocated form the allocator, including internal-fragmentation. Normally the same as `used_memory`.\n- `allocator_active`: Total bytes in the allocator active pages, this includes external-fragmentation.\n- `allocator_resident`: Total bytes resident (RSS) in the allocator, this includes pages that can be released to the OS (by [`MEMORY PURGE`](../memory-purge), or just waiting).\n- `mem_not_counted_for_evict`: Used memory that's not counted for key eviction. This is basically transient replica and AOF buffers.\n- `mem_clients_slaves`: Memory used by replica clients - Starting Redis 7.0, replica buffers share memory with the replication backlog, so this field can show 0 when replicas don't trigger an increase of memory usage.\n- `mem_clients_normal`: Memory used by normal clients\n- `mem_cluster_links`: Memory used by links to peers on the cluster bus when cluster mode is enabled.\n- `mem_aof_buffer`: Transient memory used for AOF and AOF rewrite buffers\n- `mem_replication_backlog`: Memory used by replication backlog\n- `mem_total_replication_buffers`: Total memory consumed for replication buffers - Added in Redis 7.0.\n- `mem_allocator`: Memory allocator, chosen at compile time.\n- `active_defrag_running`: When `activedefrag` is enabled, this indicates whether defragmentation is currently active, and the CPU percentage it intends to utilize.\n- `lazyfree_pending_objects`: The number of objects waiting to be freed (as a result of calling [`UNLINK`](../unlink), or [`FLUSHDB`](../flushdb) and [`FLUSHALL`](../flushall) with the **ASYNC** option)\n- `lazyfreed_objects`: The number of objects that have been lazy freed.\n\nIdeally, the `used_memory_rss` value should be only slightly higher than `used_memory`. When rss \\>\\> used, a large difference may mean there is (external) memory fragmentation, which can be evaluated by checking `allocator_frag_ratio`, `allocator_frag_bytes`. When used \\>\\> rss, it means part of Redis memory has been swapped off by the operating system: expect some significant latencies.\n\nBecause Redis does not have control over how its allocations are mapped to memory pages, high `used_memory_rss` is often the result of a spike in memory usage.\n\nWhen Redis frees memory, the memory is given back to the allocator, and the allocator may or may not give the memory back to the system. There may be a discrepancy between the `used_memory` value and memory consumption as reported by the operating system. It may be due to the fact memory has been used and released by Redis, but not given back to the system.

Unfortunately in this command the word slave is part of the protocol, so we'll be able to remove such occurrences only when this API will be naturally deprecated.\n\n**Modules generated sections**: Starting with Redis 6, modules can inject their info into the `INFO` command, these are excluded by default even when the `all` argument is provided (it will include a list of loaded modules but not their generated info fields). To get these you must use either the `modules` argument or `everything`.,\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added support for taking multiple section arguments.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/info/](https://redis.io/commands/info/)"

  description: "# LATENCY\n\n    LATENCY DOCTOR\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nLATENCY DOCTOR\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.8.13\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\nThe `LATENCY DOCTOR` command reports about different latency-related issues and advises about possible remedies.\n\nThis command is the most powerful analysis tool in the latency monitoring framework, and is able to provide additional statistical data like the average period between latency spikes, the median deviation, and a human-readable analysis of the event. For certain events, like `fork`, additional information is provided, like the rate at which the system forks processes.\n\nThis is the output you should post in the Redis mailing list if you are looking for help about Latency related issues.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n127.0.0.1:6379> latency doctor\n\nDave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance.\nYou don't mind talking about it, do you Dave?\n\n1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms,\n    period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms.\n\nI have a few advices for you:\n\n- Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are\n    slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please\n    use 'CONFIG SET slowlog-log-slower-than 1000'.\n- Check your Slow Log to understand what are the commands you are\n    running which are too slow to execute. Please check\n    http://redis.io/commands/slowlog for more information.\n- Deleting, expiring or evicting (because of maxmemory policy)\n    large objects is a blocking operation. If you have very large\n    objects that are often deleted, expired, or evicted, try to\n    fragment those objects into multiple smaller objects.\n```\n\n**Note:** the doctor has erratic psychological behaviors, so we recommend interacting with it carefully.\n\nFor more information refer to the [Latency Monitoring Framework page](https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor).\n\n## Return\n\n[Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings)\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/latency-doctor/](https://redis.io/commands/latency-doctor/)"

  summary: The LCS command implements the longest common subsequence algorithm
  description: "# LCS\n\n    LCS\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nLCS key1 key2 [LEN] [IDX] [MINMATCHLEN min-match-len] [WITHMATCHLEN]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n7.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N\\*M) where N and M are the lengths of s1 and s2, respectively\n\nACL categories:  \n`@read`, `@string`, `@slow`,\n\nThe LCS command implements the longest common subsequence algorithm. Note that this is different than the longest common string algorithm, since matching characters in the string does not need to be contiguous.\n\nFor instance the LCS between \"foo\" and \"fao\" is \"fo\", since scanning the two strings from left to right, the longest common set of characters is composed of the first \"f\" and then the \"o\".\n\nLCS is very useful in order to evaluate how similar two strings are. Strings can represent many things. For instance if two strings are DNA sequences, the LCS will provide a measure of similarity between the two DNA sequences. If the strings represent some text edited by some user, the LCS could represent how different the new text is compared to the old one, and so forth.\n\nNote that this algorithm runs in `O(N*M)` time, where N is the length of the first string and M is the length of the second string. So either spin a different Redis instance in order to run this algorithm, or make sure to run it against very small strings.\n\n```\n> MSET key1 ohmytext key2 mynewtext\nOK\n> LCS key1 key2\n\"mytext\"\n```\n\nSometimes we need just the length of the match:\n\n```\n> LCS key1 key2 LEN\n(integer) 6\n```\n\nHowever what is often very useful, is to know the match position in each strings:\n\n```\n> LCS key1 key2 IDX\n1) \"matches\"\n2) 1) 1) 1) (integer) 4\n         2) (integer) 7\n      2) 1) (integer) 5\n         2) (integer) 8\n   2) 1) 1) (integer) 2\n         2) (integer) 3\n      2) 1) (integer) 0\n         2) (integer) 1\n3) \"len\"\n4) (integer) 6\n```\n\nMatches are produced from the last one to the first one, since this is how the algorithm works, and it more efficient to emit things in the same order. The above array means that the first match (second element of the array) is between positions 2-3 of the first string and 0-1 of the second. Then there is another match between 4-7 and 5-8.\n\nTo restrict the list of matches to the ones of a given minimal length:\n\n```\n> LCS key1 key2 IDX MINMATCHLEN 4\n1) \"matches\"\n2) 1) 1) 1) (integer) 4\n         2) (integer) 7\n      2) 1) (integer) 5\n         2) (integer) 8\n3) \"len\"\n4) (integer) 6\n```\n\nFinally to also have the match len:\n\n```\n> LCS key1 key2 IDX MINMATCHLEN 4 WITHMATCHLEN\n1) \"matches\"\n2) 1) 1) 1) (integer) 4\n         2) (integer) 7\n      2) 1) (integer) 5\n         2) (integer) 8\n      3) (integer) 4\n3) \"len\"\n4) (integer) 6\n```\n\n## Return\n\n- Without modifiers the string representing the longest common substring is returned.\n- When `LEN` is given the command returns the length of the longest common substring.\n- When `IDX` is given the command returns an array with the LCS length and all the ranges in both the strings, start and end offset for each string, where there are matches. When `WITHMATCHLEN` is given each array representing a match will also have the length of the match (see examples).\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/lcs/](https://redis.io/commands/lcs/)"

A simple form of queue is often obtained pushing values into a list in the producer side, and waiting for this values in the consumer side using [`RPOP`](../rpop) (using polling), or [`BRPOP`](../brpop) if the client is better served by a blocking operation.\n\nHowever in this context the obtained queue is not *reliable* as messages can be lost, for example in the case there is a network problem or if the consumer crashes just after the message is received but it is still to process.\n\n`LMOVE` (or [`BLMOVE`](../blmove) for the blocking variant) offers a way to avoid this problem: the consumer fetches the message and at the same time pushes it into a *processing* list. It will use the [`LREM`](../lrem) command in order to remove the message from the *processing* list once the message has been processed.\n\nAn additional client may monitor the *processing* list for items that remain there for too much time, and will push those timed out items into the queue again if needed.\n\n## Pattern: Circular list\n\nUsing `LMOVE` with the same source and destination key, a client can visit all the elements of an N-elements list, one after the other, in O(N) without transferring the full list from the server to the client using a single [`LRANGE`](../lrange) operation.\n\nThe above pattern works even in the following conditions:\n\n- There are multiple clients rotating the list: they'll fetch different elements, until all the elements of the list are visited, and the process restarts.\n- Even if other clients are actively pushing new items at the end of the list.\n\nThe above makes it very simple to implement a system where a set of items must be processed by N workers continuously as fast as possible. An example is a monitoring system that must check that a set of web sites are reachable, with the smallest delay possible, using a number of parallel workers.\n\nNote that this implementation of workers is trivially scalable and reliable, because even if a message is lost the item is still in the queue and will be processed at the next iteration.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/lmove/](https://redis.io/commands/lmove/)"

The command was introduced in Redis 5 and announced with this [blog post](http://antirez.com/news/123).\n\nBy default the `LOLWUT` command will display the piece corresponding to the current Redis version, however it is possible to display a specific version using the following form:\n\n    LOLWUT VERSION 5 ... other optional arguments ...\n\nOf course the \"5\" above is an example. Each LOLWUT version takes a different set of arguments in order to change the output. The user is encouraged to play with it to discover how the output changes adding more numerical arguments.\n\nLOLWUT wants to be a reminder that there is more in programming than just putting some code together in order to create something useful. Every LOLWUT version should have the following properties:\n\n1.  It should display some computer art. There are no limits as long as the output works well in a normal terminal display. However the output should not be limited to graphics (like LOLWUT 5 and 6 actually do), but can be generative poetry and other non graphical things.\n2.  LOLWUT output should be completely useless. Displaying some useful Redis internal metrics does not count as a valid LOLWUT.\n3.  LOLWUT output should be fast to generate so that the command can be called in production instances without issues. It should remain fast even when the user experiments with odd parameters.\n4.  LOLWUT implementations should be safe and carefully checked for security, and resist to untrusted inputs if they take arguments.\n5.  LOLWUT must always display the Redis version at the end.\n\n## Return\n\n[Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings) (or verbatim reply when using the RESP3 protocol): the string containing the generative computer art, and a text with the Redis version.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/lolwut/](https://redis.io/commands/lolwut/)"

  summary: 'Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of elements in the list, for the average case'
  description: "# LPOS\n\n    LPOS\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nLPOS key element [RANK rank] [COUNT num-matches] [MAXLEN len]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n6.0.6\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N) where N is the number of elements in the list, for the average case. When searching for elements near the head or the tail of the list, or when the MAXLEN option is provided, the command may run in constant time.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@read`, `@list`, `@slow`,\n\nThe command returns the index of matching elements inside a Redis list. By default, when no options are given, it will scan the list from head to tail, looking for the first match of \"element\". If the element is found, its index (the zero-based position in the list) is returned. Otherwise, if no match is found, `nil` is returned.\n\n```\n> RPUSH mylist a b c 1 2 3 c c\n> LPOS mylist c\n2\n```\n\nThe optional arguments and options can modify the command's behavior. The `RANK` option specifies the \"rank\" of the first element to return, in case there are multiple matches. A rank of 1 means to return the first match, 2 to return the second match, and so forth.\n\nFor instance, in the above example the element \"c\" is present multiple times, if I want the index of the second match, I'll write:\n\n```\n> LPOS mylist c RANK 2\n6\n```\n\nThat is, the second occurrence of \"c\" is at position 6. A negative \"rank\" as the `RANK` argument tells `LPOS` to invert the search direction, starting from the tail to the head.\n\nSo, we want to say, give me the first element starting from the tail of the list:\n\n```\n> LPOS mylist c RANK -1\n7\n```\n\nNote that the indexes are still reported in the \"natural\" way, that is, considering the first element starting from the head of the list at index 0, the next element at index 1, and so forth. This basically means that the returned indexes are stable whatever the rank is positive or negative.\n\nSometimes we want to return not just the Nth matching element, but the position of all the first N matching elements. This can be achieved using the `COUNT` option.\n\n```\n> LPOS mylist c COUNT 2\n[2,6]\n```\n\nWe can combine `COUNT` and `RANK`, so that `COUNT` will try to return up to the specified number of matches, but starting from the Nth match, as specified by the `RANK` option.\n\n```\n> LPOS mylist c RANK -1 COUNT 2\n[7,6]\n```\n\nWhen `COUNT` is used, it is possible to specify 0 as the number of matches, as a way to tell the command we want all the matches found returned as an array of indexes. This is better than giving a very large `COUNT` option because it is more general.\n\n```\n> LPOS mylist c COUNT 0\n[2,6,7]\n```\n\nWhen `COUNT` is used and no match is found, an empty array is returned. However when `COUNT` is not used and there are no matches, the command returns `nil`.\n\nFinally, the `MAXLEN` option tells the command to compare the provided element only with a given maximum number of list items. So for instance specifying `MAXLEN 1000` will make sure that the command performs only 1000 comparisons, effectively running the algorithm on a subset of the list (the first part or the last part depending on the fact we use a positive or negative rank). This is useful to limit the maximum complexity of the command. It is also useful when we expect the match to be found very early, but want to be sure that in case this is not true, the command does not take too much time to run.\n\nWhen `MAXLEN` is used, it is possible to specify 0 as the maximum number of comparisons, as a way to tell the command we want unlimited comparisons. This is better than giving a very large `MAXLEN` option because it is more general.\n\n## Return\n\nThe command returns the integer representing the matching element, or `nil` if there is no match. However, if the `COUNT` option is given the command returns an array (empty if there are no matches).\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nRPUSH mylist a b c d 1 2 3 4 3 3 3\nLPOS mylist 3\nLPOS mylist 3 COUNT 0 RANK 2\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/lpos/](https://redis.io/commands/lpos/)"

  summary: 'Time complexity: This command actually executes a DUMP+DEL in the source instance, and a RESTORE in the target instance'
  description: "# MIGRATE\n\n    MIGRATE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nMIGRATE host port <key | \"\"> destination-db timeout [COPY] [REPLACE]\n  [AUTH password | AUTH2 username password] [KEYS key [key ...]]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.6.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nThis command actually executes a DUMP+DEL in the source instance, and a RESTORE in the target instance. See the pages of these commands for time complexity. Also an O(N) data transfer between the two instances is performed.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@keyspace`, `@write`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\nAtomically transfer a key from a source Redis instance to a destination Redis instance. On success the key is deleted from the original instance and is guaranteed to exist in the target instance.\n\nThe command is atomic and blocks the two instances for the time required to transfer the key, at any given time the key will appear to exist in a given instance or in the other instance, unless a timeout error occurs. In 3.2 and above, multiple keys can be pipelined in a single call to `MIGRATE` by passing the empty string (\"\") as key and adding the `KEYS` clause.\n\nThe command internally uses [`DUMP`](../dump) to generate the serialized version of the key value, and [`RESTORE`](../restore) in order to synthesize the key in the target instance. The source instance acts as a client for the target instance. If the target instance returns OK to the [`RESTORE`](../restore) command, the source instance deletes the key using [`DEL`](../del).\n\nThe timeout specifies the maximum idle time in any moment of the communication with the destination instance in milliseconds. This means that the operation does not need to be completed within the specified amount of milliseconds, but that the transfer should make progresses without blocking for more than the specified amount of milliseconds.\n\n`MIGRATE` needs to perform I/O operations and to honor the specified timeout. When there is an I/O error during the transfer or if the timeout is reached the operation is aborted and the special error - `IOERR` returned. When this happens the following two cases are possible:\n\n- The key may be on both the instances.\n- The key may be only in the source instance.\n\nIt is not possible for the key to get lost in the event of a timeout, but the client calling `MIGRATE`, in the event of a timeout error, should check if the key is *also* present in the target instance and act accordingly.\n\nWhen any other error is returned (starting with `ERR`) `MIGRATE` guarantees that the key is still only present in the originating instance (unless a key with the same name was also *already* present on the target instance).\n\nIf there are no keys to migrate in the source instance `NOKEY` is returned. Because missing keys are possible in normal conditions, from expiry for example, `NOKEY` isn't an error.\n\n## Migrating multiple keys with a single command call\n\nStarting with Redis 3.0.6 `MIGRATE` supports a new bulk-migration mode that uses pipelining in order to migrate multiple keys between instances without incurring in the round trip time latency and other overheads that there are when moving each key with a single `MIGRATE` call.\n\nIn order to enable this form, the `KEYS` option is used, and the normal *key* argument is set to an empty string. The actual key names will be provided after the `KEYS` argument itself, like in the following example:\n\n    MIGRATE 192.168.1.34 6379 \"\" 0 5000 KEYS key1 key2 key3\n\nWhen this form is used the `NOKEY` status code is only returned when none of the keys is present in the instance, otherwise the command is executed, even if just a single key exists.\n\n## Options\n\n- `COPY` -- Do not remove the key from the local instance.\n- `REPLACE` -- Replace existing key on the remote instance.\n- `KEYS` -- If the key argument is an empty string, the command will instead migrate all the keys that follow the `KEYS` option (see the above section for more info).\n- `AUTH` -- Authenticate with the given password to the remote instance.\n- `AUTH2` -- Authenticate with the given username and password pair (Redis 6 or greater ACL auth style).\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): The command returns OK on success, or `NOKEY` if no keys were found in the source instance.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 3.0.0: Added the `COPY` and `REPLACE` options.\n- Starting with Redis version 3.0.6: Added the `KEYS` option.\n- Starting with Redis version 4.0.7: Added the `AUTH` option.\n- Starting with Redis version 6.0.0: Added the `AUTH2` option.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/migrate/](https://redis.io/commands/migrate/)"

  summary: 'Time complexity: O(1) with a very small average constant time when called with a single key'
  description: "# PFCOUNT\n\n    PFCOUNT\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nPFCOUNT key [key ...]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.8.9\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1) with a very small average constant time when called with a single key. O(N) with N being the number of keys, and much bigger constant times, when called with multiple keys.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@read`, `@hyperloglog`, `@slow`,\n\nWhen called with a single key, returns the approximated cardinality computed by the HyperLogLog data structure stored at the specified variable, which is 0 if the variable does not exist.\n\nWhen called with multiple keys, returns the approximated cardinality of the union of the HyperLogLogs passed, by internally merging the HyperLogLogs stored at the provided keys into a temporary HyperLogLog.\n\nThe HyperLogLog data structure can be used in order to count **unique** elements in a set using just a small constant amount of memory, specifically 12k bytes for every HyperLogLog (plus a few bytes for the key itself).\n\nThe returned cardinality of the observed set is not exact, but approximated with a standard error of 0.81%.\n\nFor example in order to take the count of all the unique search queries performed in a day, a program needs to call [`PFADD`](../pfadd) every time a query is processed. The estimated number of unique queries can be retrieved with `PFCOUNT` at any time.\n\nNote: as a side effect of calling this function, it is possible that the HyperLogLog is modified, since the last 8 bytes encode the latest computed cardinality for caching purposes. So `PFCOUNT` is technically a write command.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers), specifically:\n\n- The approximated number of unique elements observed via [`PFADD`](../pfadd).\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nPFADD hll foo bar zap\nPFADD hll zap zap zap\nPFADD hll foo bar\nPFCOUNT hll\nPFADD some-other-hll 1 2 3\nPFCOUNT hll some-other-hll\n```\n\n## Performances\n\nWhen `PFCOUNT` is called with a single key, performances are excellent even if in theory constant times to process a dense HyperLogLog are high. This is possible because the `PFCOUNT` uses caching in order to remember the cardinality previously computed, that rarely changes because most [`PFADD`](../pfadd) operations will not update any register. Hundreds of operations per second are possible.\n\nWhen `PFCOUNT` is called with multiple keys, an on-the-fly merge of the HyperLogLogs is performed, which is slow, moreover the cardinality of the union can't be cached, so when used with multiple keys `PFCOUNT` may take a time in the order of magnitude of the millisecond, and should be not abused.\n\nThe user should take in mind that single-key and multiple-keys executions of this command are semantically different and have different performances.\n\n## HyperLogLog representation\n\nRedis HyperLogLogs are represented using a double representation: the *sparse* representation suitable for HLLs counting a small number of elements (resulting in a small number of registers set to non-zero value), and a *dense* representation suitable for higher cardinalities. Redis automatically switches from the sparse to the dense representation when needed.\n\nThe sparse representation uses a run-length encoding optimized to store efficiently a big number of registers set to zero. The dense representation is a Redis string of 12288 bytes in order to store 16384 6-bit counters. The need for the double representation comes from the fact that using 12k (which is the dense representation memory requirement) to encode just a few registers for smaller cardinalities is extremely suboptimal.\n\nBoth representations are prefixed with a 16 bytes header, that includes a magic, an encoding / version field, and the cached cardinality estimation computed, stored in little endian format (the most significant bit is 1 if the estimation is invalid since the HyperLogLog was updated since the cardinality was computed).\n\nThe HyperLogLog, being a Redis string, can be retrieved with [`GET`](../get) and restored with [`SET`](../set). Calling [`PFADD`](../pfadd), `PFCOUNT` or [`PFMERGE`](../pfmerge) commands with a corrupted HyperLogLog is never a problem, it may return random values but does not affect the stability of the server. Most of the times when corrupting a sparse representation, the server recognizes the corruption and returns an error.\n\nThe representation is neutral from the point of view of the processor word size and endianness, so the same representation is used by 32 bit and 64 bit processor, big endian or little endian.\n\nMore details about the Redis HyperLogLog implementation can be found in [this blog post](http://antirez.com/news/75). The source code of the implementation in the `hyperloglog.c` file is also easy to read and understand, and includes a full specification for the exact encoding used for the sparse and dense representations.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/pfcount/](https://redis.io/commands/pfcount/)"

A simple form of queue is often obtained pushing values into a list in the producer side, and waiting for this values in the consumer side using [`RPOP`](../rpop) (using polling), or [`BRPOP`](../brpop) if the client is better served by a blocking operation.\n\nHowever in this context the obtained queue is not *reliable* as messages can be lost, for example in the case there is a network problem or if the consumer crashes just after the message is received but before it can be processed.\n\n`RPOPLPUSH` (or [`BRPOPLPUSH`](../brpoplpush) for the blocking variant) offers a way to avoid this problem: the consumer fetches the message and at the same time pushes it into a *processing* list. It will use the [`LREM`](../lrem) command in order to remove the message from the *processing* list once the message has been processed.\n\nAn additional client may monitor the *processing* list for items that remain there for too much time, pushing timed out items into the queue again if needed.\n\n## Pattern: Circular list\n\nUsing `RPOPLPUSH` with the same source and destination key, a client can visit all the elements of an N-elements list, one after the other, in O(N) without transferring the full list from the server to the client using a single [`LRANGE`](../lrange) operation.\n\nThe above pattern works even if one or both of the following conditions occur:\n\n- There are multiple clients rotating the list: they'll fetch different elements, until all the elements of the list are visited, and the process restarts.\n- Other clients are actively pushing new items at the end of the list.\n\nThe above makes it very simple to implement a system where a set of items must be processed by N workers continuously as fast as possible. An example is a monitoring system that must check that a set of web sites are reachable, with the smallest delay possible, using a number of parallel workers.\n\nNote that this implementation of workers is trivially scalable and reliable, because even if a message is lost the item is still in the queue and will be processed at the next iteration.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/rpoplpush/](https://redis.io/commands/rpoplpush/)"

O(N) for a complete iteration, including enough command calls for the cursor to return back to 0. N is the number of elements inside the collection.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@keyspace`, `@read`, `@slow`,\n\nThe `SCAN` command and the closely related commands [`SSCAN`](../sscan), [`HSCAN`](../hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](../zscan) are used in order to incrementally iterate over a collection of elements.\n\n- `SCAN` iterates the set of keys in the currently selected Redis database.\n- [`SSCAN`](../sscan) iterates elements of Sets types.\n- [`HSCAN`](../hscan) iterates fields of Hash types and their associated values.\n- [`ZSCAN`](../zscan) iterates elements of Sorted Set types and their associated scores.\n\nSince these commands allow for incremental iteration, returning only a small number of elements per call, they can be used in production without the downside of commands like [`KEYS`](../keys) or [`SMEMBERS`](../smembers) that may block the server for a long time (even several seconds) when called against big collections of keys or elements.\n\nHowever while blocking commands like [`SMEMBERS`](../smembers) are able to provide all the elements that are part of a Set in a given moment, The SCAN family of commands only offer limited guarantees about the returned elements since the collection that we incrementally iterate can change during the iteration process.\n\nNote that `SCAN`, [`SSCAN`](../sscan), [`HSCAN`](../hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](../zscan) all work very similarly, so this documentation covers all the four commands. However an obvious difference is that in the case of [`SSCAN`](../sscan), [`HSCAN`](../hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](../zscan) the first argument is the name of the key holding the Set, Hash or Sorted Set value. The `SCAN` command does not need any key name argument as it iterates keys in the current database, so the iterated object is the database itself.\n\n## SCAN basic usage\n\nSCAN is a cursor based iterator. This means that at every call of the command, the server returns an updated cursor that the user needs to use as the cursor argument in the next call.\n\nAn iteration starts when the cursor is set to 0, and terminates when the cursor returned by the server is 0. The following is an example of SCAN iteration:\n\n```\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> scan 0\n1) \"17\"\n2)  1) \"key:12\"\n    2) \"key:8\"\n    3) \"key:4\"\n    4) \"key:14\"\n    5) \"key:16\"\n    6) \"key:17\"\n    7) \"key:15\"\n    8) \"key:10\"\n    9) \"key:3\"\n   10) \"key:7\"\n   11) \"key:1\"\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> scan 17\n1) \"0\"\n2) 1) \"key:5\"\n   2) \"key:18\"\n   3) \"key:0\"\n   4) \"key:2\"\n   5) \"key:19\"\n   6) \"key:13\"\n   7) \"key:6\"\n   8) \"key:9\"\n   9) \"key:11\"\n```\n\nIn the example above, the first call uses zero as a cursor, to start the iteration. The second call uses the cursor returned by the previous call as the first element of the reply, that is, 17.\n\nAs you can see the **SCAN return value** is an array of two values: the first value is the new cursor to use in the next call, the second value is an array of elements.\n\nSince in the second call the returned cursor is 0, the server signaled to the caller that the iteration finished, and the collection was completely explored. Starting an iteration with a cursor value of 0, and calling `SCAN` until the returned cursor is 0 again is called a **full iteration**.\n\n## Scan guarantees\n\nThe `SCAN` command, and the other commands in the `SCAN` family, are able to provide to the user a set of guarantees associated to full iterations.\n\n- A full iteration always retrieves all the elements that were present in the collection from the start to the end of a full iteration. This means that if a given element is inside the collection when an iteration is started, and is still there when an iteration terminates, then at some point `SCAN` returned it to the user.\n- A full iteration never returns any element that was NOT present in the collection from the start to the end of a full iteration. So if an element was removed before the start of an iteration, and is never added back to the collection for all the time an iteration lasts, `SCAN` ensures that this element will never be returned.\n\nHowever because `SCAN` has very little state associated (just the cursor) it has the following drawbacks:\n\n- A given element may be returned multiple times. It is up to the application to handle the case of duplicated elements, for example only using the returned elements in order to perform operations that are safe when re-applied multiple times.\n- Elements that were not constantly present in the collection during a full iteration, may be returned or not: it is undefined.\n\n## Number of elements returned at every SCAN call\n\n`SCAN` family functions do not guarantee that the number of elements returned per call are in a given range. The commands are also allowed to return zero elements, and the client should not consider the iteration complete as long as the returned cursor is not zero.\n\nHowever the number of returned elements is reasonable, that is, in practical terms SCAN may return a maximum number of elements in the order of a few tens of elements when iterating a large collection, or may return all the elements of the collection in a single call when the iterated collection is small enough to be internally represented as an encoded data structure (this happens for small sets, hashes and sorted sets).\n\nHowever there is a way for the user to tune the order of magnitude of the number of returned elements per call using the **COUNT** option.\n\n## The COUNT option\n\nWhile `SCAN` does not provide guarantees about the number of elements returned at every iteration, it is possible to empirically adjust the behavior of `SCAN` using the **COUNT** option. Basically with COUNT the user specified the *amount of work that should be done at every call in order to retrieve elements from the collection*. This is **just a hint** for the implementation, however generally speaking this is what you could expect most of the times from the implementation.\n\n- The default COUNT value is 10.\n- When iterating the key space, or a Set, Hash or Sorted Set that is big enough to be represented by a hash table, assuming no **MATCH** option is used, the server will usually return *count* or a bit more than *count* elements per call. Please check the *why SCAN may return all the elements at once* section later in this document.\n- When iterating Sets encoded as intsets (small sets composed of just integers), or Hashes and Sorted Sets encoded as ziplists (small hashes and sets composed of small individual values), usually all the elements are returned in the first `SCAN` call regardless of the COUNT value.\n\nImportant: **there is no need to use the same COUNT value** for every iteration. The caller is free to change the count from one iteration to the other as required, as long as the cursor passed in the next call is the one obtained in the previous call to the command.\n\n## The MATCH option\n\nIt is possible to only iterate elements matching a given glob-style pattern, similarly to the behavior of the [`KEYS`](../keys) command that takes a pattern as its only argument.\n\nTo do so, just append the `MATCH <pattern>` arguments at the end of the `SCAN` command (it works with all the SCAN family commands).\n\nThis is an example of iteration using **MATCH**:\n\n```\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> sadd myset 1 2 3 foo foobar feelsgood\n(integer) 6\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> sscan myset 0 match f*\n1) \"0\"\n2) 1) \"foo\"\n   2) \"feelsgood\"\n   3) \"foobar\"\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379>\n```\n\nIt is important to note that the **MATCH** filter is applied after elements are retrieved from the collection, just before returning data to the client. This means that if the pattern matches very little elements inside the collection, `SCAN` will likely return no elements in most iterations. An example is shown below:\n\n```\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> scan 0 MATCH *11*\n1) \"288\"\n2) 1) \"key:911\"\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> scan 288 MATCH *11*\n1) \"224\"\n2) (empty list or set)\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> scan 224 MATCH *11*\n1) \"80\"\n2) (empty list or set)\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> scan 80 MATCH *11*\n1) \"176\"\n2) (empty list or set)\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> scan 176 MATCH *11* COUNT 1000\n1) \"0\"\n2)  1) \"key:611\"\n    2) \"key:711\"\n    3) \"key:118\"\n    4) \"key:117\"\n    5) \"key:311\"\n    6) \"key:112\"\n    7) \"key:111\"\n    8) \"key:110\"\n    9) \"key:113\"\n   10) \"key:211\"\n   11) \"key:411\"\n   12) \"key:115\"\n   13) \"key:116\"\n   14) \"key:114\"\n   15) \"key:119\"\n   16) \"key:811\"\n   17) \"key:511\"\n   18) \"key:11\"\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379>\n```\n\nAs you can see most of the calls returned zero elements, but the last call where a COUNT of 1000 was used in order to force the command to do more scanning for that iteration.\n\n## The TYPE option\n\nYou can use the `TYPE` option to ask `SCAN` to only return objects that match a given `type`, allowing you to iterate through the database looking for keys of a specific type. The **TYPE** option is only available on the whole-database `SCAN`, not [`HSCAN`](../hscan) or [`ZSCAN`](../zscan) etc.\n\nThe `type` argument is the same string name that the [`TYPE`](../type) command returns. Note a quirk where some Redis types, such as GeoHashes, HyperLogLogs, Bitmaps, and Bitfields, may internally be implemented using other Redis types, such as a string or zset, so can't be distinguished from other keys of that same type by `SCAN`. For example, a ZSET and GEOHASH:\n\n```\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> GEOADD geokey 0 0 value\n(integer) 1\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> ZADD zkey 1000 value\n(integer) 1\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> TYPE geokey\nzset\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> TYPE zkey\nzset\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> SCAN 0 TYPE zset\n1) \"0\"\n2) 1) \"geokey\"\n   2) \"zkey\"\n```\n\nIt is important to note that the **TYPE** filter is also applied after elements are retrieved from the database, so the option does not reduce the amount of work the server has to do to complete a full iteration, and for rare types you may receive no elements in many iterations.\n\n## Multiple parallel iterations\n\nIt is possible for an infinite number of clients to iterate the same collection at the same time, as the full state of the iterator is in the cursor, that is obtained and returned to the client at every call. No server side state is taken at all.\n\n## Terminating iterations in the middle\n\nSince there is no state server side, but the full state is captured by the cursor, the caller is free to terminate an iteration half-way without signaling this to the server in any way. An infinite number of iterations can be started and never terminated without any issue.\n\n## Calling SCAN with a corrupted cursor\n\nCalling `SCAN` with a broken, negative, out of range, or otherwise invalid cursor, will result in undefined behavior but never in a crash. What will be undefined is that the guarantees about the returned elements can no longer be ensured by the `SCAN` implementation.\n\nThe only valid cursors to use are:\n\n- The cursor value of 0 when starting an iteration.\n- The cursor returned by the previous call to SCAN in order to continue the iteration.\n\n## Guarantee of termination\n\nThe `SCAN` algorithm is guaranteed to terminate only if the size of the iterated collection remains bounded to a given maximum size, otherwise iterating a collection that always grows may result into `SCAN` to never terminate a full iteration.\n\nThis is easy to see intuitively: if the collection grows there is more and more work to do in order to visit all the possible elements, and the ability to terminate the iteration depends on the number of calls to `SCAN` and its COUNT option value compared with the rate at which the collection grows.\n\n## Why SCAN may return all the items of an aggregate data type in a single call?\n\nIn the `COUNT` option documentation, we state that sometimes this family of commands may return all the elements of a Set, Hash or Sorted Set at once in a single call, regardless of the `COUNT` option value. The reason why this happens is that the cursor-based iterator can be implemented, and is useful, only when the aggregate data type that we are scanning is represented as a hash table. However Redis uses a [memory optimization](https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization) where small aggregate data types, until they reach a given amount of items or a given max size of single elements, are represented using a compact single-allocation packed encoding. When this is the case, `SCAN` has no meaningful cursor to return, and must iterate the whole data structure at once, so the only sane behavior it has is to return everything in a call.\n\nHowever once the data structures are bigger and are promoted to use real hash tables, the `SCAN` family of commands will resort to the normal behavior. Note that since this special behavior of returning all the elements is true only for small aggregates, it has no effects on the command complexity or latency. However the exact limits to get converted into real hash tables are [user configurable](https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization), so the maximum number of elements you can see returned in a single call depends on how big an aggregate data type could be and still use the packed representation.\n\nAlso note that this behavior is specific of [`SSCAN`](../sscan), [`HSCAN`](../hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](../zscan). `SCAN` itself never shows this behavior because the key space is always represented by hash tables.\n\n## Return value\n\n`SCAN`, [`SSCAN`](../sscan), [`HSCAN`](../hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](../zscan) return a two elements multi-bulk reply, where the first element is a string representing an unsigned 64 bit number (the cursor), and the second element is a multi-bulk with an array of elements.\n\n- `SCAN` array of elements is a list of keys.\n- [`SSCAN`](../sscan) array of elements is a list of Set members.\n- [`HSCAN`](../hscan) array of elements contain two elements, a field and a value, for every returned element of the Hash.\n- [`ZSCAN`](../zscan) array of elements contain two elements, a member and its associated score, for every returned element of the sorted set.\n\n## Additional examples\n\nIteration of a Hash value.\n\n```\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> hmset hash name Jack age 33\nOK\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> hscan hash 0\n1) \"0\"\n2) 1) \"name\"\n   2) \"Jack\"\n   3) \"age\"\n   4) \"33\"\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.0.0: Added the `TYPE` subcommand.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/scan/](https://redis.io/commands/scan/)"

  summary: Sets or clears the bit at offset in the string value stored at key
  description: "# SETBIT\n\n    SETBIT\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nSETBIT key offset value\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@bitmap`, `@slow`,\n\nSets or clears the bit at *offset* in the string value stored at *key*.\n\nThe bit is either set or cleared depending on *value*, which can be either 0 or 1.\n\nWhen *key* does not exist, a new string value is created. The string is grown to make sure it can hold a bit at *offset*. The *offset* argument is required to be greater than or equal to 0, and smaller than 2^32 (this limits bitmaps to 512MB). When the string at *key* is grown, added bits are set to 0.\n\n**Warning**: When setting the last possible bit (*offset* equal to 2^32 -1) and the string value stored at *key* does not yet hold a string value, or holds a small string value, Redis needs to allocate all intermediate memory which can block the server for some time. On a 2010 MacBook Pro, setting bit number 2^32 -1 (512MB allocation) takes ~300ms, setting bit number 2^30 -1 (128MB allocation) takes ~80ms, setting bit number 2^28 -1 (32MB allocation) takes ~30ms and setting bit number 2^26 -1 (8MB allocation) takes ~8ms. Note that once this first allocation is done, subsequent calls to `SETBIT` for the same *key* will not have the allocation overhead.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): the original bit value stored at *offset*.\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nSETBIT mykey 7 1\nSETBIT mykey 7 0\nGET mykey\n```\n\n## Pattern: accessing the entire bitmap\n\nThere are cases when you need to set all the bits of single bitmap at once, for example when initializing it to a default non-zero value. It is possible to do this with multiple calls to the `SETBIT` command, one for each bit that needs to be set. However, so as an optimization you can use a single [`SET`](../set) command to set the entire bitmap.\n\nBitmaps are not an actual data type, but a set of bit-oriented operations defined on the String type (for more information refer to the [Bitmaps section of the Data Types Introduction page](https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#bitmaps)). This means that bitmaps can be used with string commands, and most importantly with [`SET`](../set) and [`GET`](../get).\n\nBecause Redis' strings are binary-safe, a bitmap is trivially encoded as a bytes stream. The first byte of the string corresponds to offsets 0..7 of the bitmap, the second byte to the 8..15 range, and so forth.\n\nFor example, after setting a few bits, getting the string value of the bitmap would look like this:\n\n```\n> SETBIT bitmapsarestrings 2 1\n> SETBIT bitmapsarestrings 3 1\n> SETBIT bitmapsarestrings 5 1\n> SETBIT bitmapsarestrings 10 1\n> SETBIT bitmapsarestrings 11 1\n> SETBIT bitmapsarestrings 14 1\n> GET bitmapsarestrings\n\"42\"\n```\n\nBy getting the string representation of a bitmap, the client can then parse the response's bytes by extracting the bit values using native bit operations in its native programming language. Symmetrically, it is also possible to set an entire bitmap by performing the bits-to-bytes encoding in the client and calling [`SET`](../set) with the resultant string.\n\n## Pattern: setting multiple bits\n\n`SETBIT` excels at setting single bits, and can be called several times when multiple bits need to be set. To optimize this operation you can replace multiple `SETBIT` calls with a single call to the variadic [`BITFIELD`](../bitfield) command and the use of fields of type `u1`.\n\nFor example, the example above could be replaced by:\n\n```\n> BITFIELD bitsinabitmap SET u1 2 1 SET u1 3 1 SET u1 5 1 SET u1 10 1 SET u1 11 1 SET u1 14 1\n```\n\n## Advanced Pattern: accessing bitmap ranges\n\nIt is also possible to use the [`GETRANGE`](../getrange) and [`SETRANGE`](../setrange) string commands to efficiently access a range of bit offsets in a bitmap. Below is a sample implementation in idiomatic Redis Lua scripting that can be run with the [`EVAL`](../eval) command:\n\n```\n--[[\nSets a bitmap range\n\nBitmaps are stored as Strings in Redis. A range spans one or more bytes,\nso we can call [`SETRANGE`](/commands/setrange) when entire bytes need to be set instead of flipping\nindividual bits. Also, to avoid multiple internal memory allocations in\nRedis, we traverse in reverse.\nExpected input:\n  KEYS[1] - bitfield key\n  ARGV[1] - start offset (0-based, inclusive)\n  ARGV[2] - end offset (same, should be bigger than start, no error checking)\n  ARGV[3] - value (should be 0 or 1, no error checking)\n]]--\n\n-- A helper function to stringify a binary string to semi-binary format\nlocal function tobits(str)\n  local r = ''\n  for i = 1, string.len(str) do\n    local c = string.byte(str, i)\n    local b = ' '\n    for j = 0, 7 do\n      b = tostring(bit.band(c, 1)) .. b\n      c = bit.rshift(c, 1)\n    end\n    r = r .. b\n  end\n  return r\nend\n\n-- Main\nlocal k = KEYS[1]\nlocal s, e, v = tonumber(ARGV[1]), tonumber(ARGV[2]), tonumber(ARGV[3])\n\n-- First treat the dangling bits in the last byte\nlocal ms, me = s % 8, (e + 1) % 8\nif me > 0 then\n  local t = math.max(e - me + 1, s)\n  for i = e, t, -1 do\n    redis.call('SETBIT', k, i, v)\n  end\n  e = t\nend\n\n-- Then the danglings in the first byte\nif ms > 0 then\n  local t = math.min(s - ms + 7, e)\n  for i = s, t, 1 do\n    redis.call('SETBIT', k, i, v)\n  end\n  s = t + 1\nend\n\n-- Set a range accordingly, if at all\nlocal rs, re = s / 8, (e + 1) / 8\nlocal rl = re - rs\nif rl > 0 then\n  local b = '\\255'\n  if 0 == v then\n    b = '\\0'\n  end\n  redis.call('SETRANGE', k, rs, string.rep(b, rl))\nend\n```\n\n**Note:** the implementation for getting a range of bit offsets from a bitmap is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/setbit/](https://redis.io/commands/setbit/)"

The following pattern is discouraged in favor of [the Redlock algorithm](https://redis.io/topics/distlock) which is only a bit more complex to implement, but offers better guarantees and is fault tolerant.\n2.  We document the old pattern anyway because certain existing implementations link to this page as a reference. Moreover it is an interesting example of how Redis commands can be used in order to mount programming primitives.\n3.  Anyway even assuming a single-instance locking primitive, starting with 2.6.12 it is possible to create a much simpler locking primitive, equivalent to the one discussed here, using the [`SET`](../set) command to acquire the lock, and a simple Lua script to release the lock. The pattern is documented in the [`SET`](../set) command page.\n\nThat said, `SETNX` can be used, and was historically used, as a locking primitive. For example, to acquire the lock of the key `foo`, the client could try the following:\n\n```\nSETNX lock.foo <current Unix time + lock timeout + 1>\n```\n\nIf `SETNX` returns `1` the client acquired the lock, setting the `lock.foo` key to the Unix time at which the lock should no longer be considered valid. The client will later use `DEL lock.foo` in order to release the lock.\n\nIf `SETNX` returns `0` the key is already locked by some other client. We can either return to the caller if it's a non blocking lock, or enter a loop retrying to hold the lock until we succeed or some kind of timeout expires.\n\n### Handling deadlocks\n\nIn the above locking algorithm there is a problem: what happens if a client fails, crashes, or is otherwise not able to release the lock? It's possible to detect this condition because the lock key contains a UNIX timestamp. If such a timestamp is equal to the current Unix time the lock is no longer valid.\n\nWhen this happens we can't just call [`DEL`](../del) against the key to remove the lock and then try to issue a `SETNX`, as there is a race condition here, when multiple clients detected an expired lock and are trying to release it.\n\n- C1 and C2 read `lock.foo` to check the timestamp, because they both received `0` after executing `SETNX`, as the lock is still held by C3 that crashed after holding the lock.\n- C1 sends `DEL lock.foo`\n- C1 sends `SETNX lock.foo` and it succeeds\n- C2 sends `DEL lock.foo`\n- C2 sends `SETNX lock.foo` and it succeeds\n- **ERROR**: both C1 and C2 acquired the lock because of the race condition.\n\nFortunately, it's possible to avoid this issue using the following algorithm. Let's see how C4, our sane client, uses the good algorithm:\n\n- C4 sends `SETNX lock.foo` in order to acquire the lock\n\n- The crashed client C3 still holds it, so Redis will reply with `0` to C4.\n\n- C4 sends `GET lock.foo` to check if the lock expired. If it is not, it will sleep for some time and retry from the start.\n\n- Instead, if the lock is expired because the Unix time at `lock.foo` is older than the current Unix time, C4 tries to perform:\n\n  ```\n  GETSET lock.foo <current Unix timestamp + lock timeout + 1>\n  ```\n\n- Because of the [`GETSET`](../getset) semantic, C4 can check if the old value stored at `key` is still an expired timestamp. If it is, the lock was acquired.\n\n- If another client, for instance C5, was faster than C4 and acquired the lock with the [`GETSET`](../getset) operation, the C4 [`GETSET`](../getset) operation will return a non expired timestamp. C4 will simply restart from the first step. Note that even if C4 set the key a bit a few seconds in the future this is not a problem.\n\nIn order to make this locking algorithm more robust, a client holding a lock should always check the timeout didn't expire before unlocking the key with [`DEL`](../del) because client failures can be complex, not just crashing but also blocking a lot of time against some operations and trying to issue [`DEL`](../del) after a lot of time (when the LOCK is already held by another client).\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/setnx/](https://redis.io/commands/setnx/)"

  summary: 'Time complexity: O(1), not counting the time taken to copy the new string in place'
  description: "# SETRANGE\n\n    SETRANGE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nSETRANGE key offset value\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n2.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1), not counting the time taken to copy the new string in place. Usually, this string is very small so the amortized complexity is O(1). Otherwise, complexity is O(M) with M being the length of the value argument.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@string`, `@slow`,\n\nOverwrites part of the string stored at *key*, starting at the specified offset, for the entire length of *value*. If the offset is larger than the current length of the string at *key*, the string is padded with zero-bytes to make *offset* fit. Non-existing keys are considered as empty strings, so this command will make sure it holds a string large enough to be able to set *value* at *offset*.\n\nNote that the maximum offset that you can set is 2^29 -1 (536870911), as Redis Strings are limited to 512 megabytes. If you need to grow beyond this size, you can use multiple keys.\n\n**Warning**: When setting the last possible byte and the string value stored at *key* does not yet hold a string value, or holds a small string value, Redis needs to allocate all intermediate memory which can block the server for some time. On a 2010 MacBook Pro, setting byte number 536870911 (512MB allocation) takes ~300ms, setting byte number 134217728 (128MB allocation) takes ~80ms, setting bit number 33554432 (32MB allocation) takes ~30ms and setting bit number 8388608 (8MB allocation) takes ~8ms. Note that once this first allocation is done, subsequent calls to `SETRANGE` for the same *key* will not have the allocation overhead.\n\n## Patterns\n\nThanks to `SETRANGE` and the analogous [`GETRANGE`](../getrange) commands, you can use Redis strings as a linear array with O(1) random access.

  summary: If persistence is enabled this commands makes sure that Redis is switched off without any data loss
  description: "# SHUTDOWN\n\n    SHUTDOWN\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nSHUTDOWN [NOSAVE | SAVE] [NOW] [FORCE] [ABORT]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n1.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N) when saving, where N is the total number of keys in all databases when saving data, otherwise O(1)\n\nACL categories:  \n`@admin`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\nThe command behavior is the following:\n\n- If there are any replicas lagging behind in replication:\n  - Pause clients attempting to write by performing a [`CLIENT PAUSE`](../client-pause) with the `WRITE` option.\n  - Wait up to the configured `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up the replication offset.\n- Stop all the clients.\n- Perform a blocking SAVE if at least one **save point** is configured.\n- Flush the Append Only File if AOF is enabled.\n- Quit the server.\n\nIf persistence is enabled this commands makes sure that Redis is switched off without any data loss.\n\nNote: A Redis instance that is configured for not persisting on disk (no AOF configured, nor \"save\" directive) will not dump the RDB file on `SHUTDOWN`, as usually you don't want Redis instances used only for caching to block on when shutting down.\n\nAlso note: If Redis receives one of the signals `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`, the same shutdown sequence is performed. See also [Signal Handling](https://redis.io/topics/signals).\n\n## Modifiers\n\nIt is possible to specify optional modifiers to alter the behavior of the command. Specifically:\n\n- **SAVE** will force a DB saving operation even if no save points are configured.\n- **NOSAVE** will prevent a DB saving operation even if one or more save points are configured.\n- **NOW** skips waiting for lagging replicas, i.e. it bypasses the first step in the shutdown sequence.\n- **FORCE** ignores any errors that would normally prevent the server from exiting. For details, see the following section.\n- **ABORT** cancels an ongoing shutdown and cannot be combined with other flags.\n\n## Conditions where a SHUTDOWN fails\n\nWhen a save point is configured or the **SAVE** modifier is specified, the shutdown may fail if the RDB file can't be saved. Then, the server continues to run in order to ensure no data loss. This may be bypassed using the **FORCE** modifier, causing the server to exit anyway.\n\nWhen the Append Only File is enabled the shutdown may fail because the system is in a state that does not allow to safely immediately persist on disk.\n\nNormally if there is an AOF child process performing an AOF rewrite, Redis will simply kill it and exit. However, there are situations where it is unsafe to do so and, unless the **FORCE** modifier is specified, the **SHUTDOWN** command will be refused with an error instead. This happens in the following situations:\n\n- The user just turned on AOF, and the server triggered the first AOF rewrite in order to create the initial AOF file. In this context, stopping will result in losing the dataset at all: once restarted, the server will potentially have AOF enabled without having any AOF file at all.\n- A replica with AOF enabled, reconnected with its master, performed a full resynchronization, and restarted the AOF file, triggering the initial AOF creation process. In this case not completing the AOF rewrite is dangerous because the latest dataset received from the master would be lost. The new master can actually be even a different instance (if the **REPLICAOF** or **SLAVEOF** command was used in order to reconfigure the replica), so it is important to finish the AOF rewrite and start with the correct data set representing the data set in memory when the server was terminated.\n\nThere are situations when we want just to terminate a Redis instance ASAP, regardless of what its content is. In such a case, the command **SHUTDOWN NOW NOSAVE FORCE** can be used. In versions before 7.0, where the **NOW** and **FORCE** flags are not available, the right combination of commands is to send a **CONFIG appendonly no** followed by a **SHUTDOWN NOSAVE**. The first command will turn off the AOF if needed, and will terminate the AOF rewriting child if there is one active. The second command will not have any problem to execute since the AOF is no longer enabled.\n\n## Minimize the risk of data loss\n\nSince Redis 7.0, the server waits for lagging replicas up to a configurable `shutdown-timeout`, by default 10 seconds, before shutting down. This provides a best effort minimizing the risk of data loss in a situation where no save points are configured and AOF is disabled. Before version 7.0, shutting down a heavily loaded master node in a diskless setup was more likely to result in data loss. To minimize the risk of data loss in such setups, it's advised to trigger a manual [`FAILOVER`](../failover) (or [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](../cluster-failover)) to demote the master to a replica and promote one of the replicas to be the new master, before shutting down a master node.\n\n## Return\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings): `OK` if `ABORT` was specified and shutdown was aborted. On successful shutdown, nothing is returned since the server quits and the connection is closed. On failure, an error is returned.\n\n## Behavior change history\n\n- `>= 7.0.0`: Introduced waiting for lagging replicas before exiting.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added the `NOW`, `FORCE` and `ABORT` modifiers.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/shutdown/](https://redis.io/commands/shutdown/)"

When the elements are not sorted, complexity is O(N).\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@set`, `@sortedset`, `@list`, `@slow`, `@dangerous`,\n\nReturns or stores the elements contained in the [list](https://redis.io/topics/data-types#lists), [set](https://redis.io/topics/data-types#set) or [sorted set](https://redis.io/topics/data-types#sorted-sets) at `key`.\n\nThere is also the [`SORT_RO`](../sort_ro) read-only variant of this command.\n\nBy default, sorting is numeric and elements are compared by their value interpreted as double precision floating point number. This is `SORT` in its simplest form:\n\n```\nSORT mylist\n```\n\nAssuming `mylist` is a list of numbers, this command will return the same list with the elements sorted from small to large. In order to sort the numbers from large to small, use the `DESC` modifier:\n\n```\nSORT mylist DESC\n```\n\nWhen `mylist` contains string values and you want to sort them lexicographically, use the `ALPHA` modifier:\n\n```\nSORT mylist ALPHA\n```\n\nRedis is UTF-8 aware, assuming you correctly set the `LC_COLLATE` environment variable.\n\nThe number of returned elements can be limited using the `LIMIT` modifier. This modifier takes the `offset` argument, specifying the number of elements to skip and the `count` argument, specifying the number of elements to return from starting at `offset`. The following example will return 10 elements of the sorted version of `mylist`, starting at element 0 (`offset` is zero-based):\n\n```\nSORT mylist LIMIT 0 10\n```\n\nAlmost all modifiers can be used together. The following example will return the first 5 elements, lexicographically sorted in descending order:\n\n```\nSORT mylist LIMIT 0 5 ALPHA DESC\n```\n\n## Sorting by external keys\n\nSometimes you want to sort elements using external keys as weights to compare instead of comparing the actual elements in the list, set or sorted set. Let's say the list `mylist` contains the elements `1`, `2` and `3` representing unique IDs of objects stored in `object_1`, `object_2` and `object_3`. When these objects have associated weights stored in `weight_1`, `weight_2` and `weight_3`, `SORT` can be instructed to use these weights to sort `mylist` with the following statement:\n\n```\nSORT mylist BY weight_*\n```\n\nThe `BY` option takes a pattern (equal to `weight_*` in this example) that is used to generate the keys that are used for sorting. These key names are obtained substituting the first occurrence of `*` with the actual value of the element in the list (`1`, `2` and `3` in this example).\n\n## Skip sorting the elements\n\nThe `BY` option can also take a non-existent key, which causes `SORT` to skip the sorting operation. This is useful if you want to retrieve external keys (see the `GET` option below) without the overhead of sorting.\n\n```\nSORT mylist BY nosort\n```\n\n## Retrieving external keys\n\nOur previous example returns just the sorted IDs. In some cases, it is more useful to get the actual objects instead of their IDs (`object_1`, `object_2` and `object_3`). Retrieving external keys based on the elements in a list, set or sorted set can be done with the following command:\n\n```\nSORT mylist BY weight_* GET object_*\n```\n\nThe `GET` option can be used multiple times in order to get more keys for every element of the original list, set or sorted set.\n\nIt is also possible to `GET` the element itself using the special pattern `#`:\n\n```\nSORT mylist BY weight_* GET object_* GET #\n```\n\n## Restrictions for using external keys\n\nWhen enabling `Redis cluster-mode` there is no way to guarantee the existence of the external keys on the node which the command is processed on. In this case, any use of [`GET`](../get) or `BY` which reference external key pattern will cause the command to fail with an error.\n\nStarting from Redis 7.0, any use of [`GET`](../get) or `BY` which reference external key pattern will only be allowed in case the current user running the command has full key read permissions. Full key read permissions can be set for the user by, for example, specifying `'%R~*'` or `'~*` with the relevant command access rules. You can check the [`ACL SETUSER`](../acl-setuser) command manual for more information on setting ACL access rules. If full key read permissions aren't set, the command will fail with an error.\n\n## Storing the result of a SORT operation\n\nBy default, `SORT` returns the sorted elements to the client. With the `STORE` option, the result will be stored as a list at the specified key instead of being returned to the client.\n\n```\nSORT mylist BY weight_* STORE resultkey\n```\n\nAn interesting pattern using `SORT ... STORE` consists in associating an [`EXPIRE`](../expire) timeout to the resulting key so that in applications where the result of a `SORT` operation can be cached for some time. Other clients will use the cached list instead of calling `SORT` for every request. When the key will timeout, an updated version of the cache can be created by calling `SORT ... STORE` again.\n\nNote that for correctly implementing this pattern it is important to avoid multiple clients rebuilding the cache at the same time. Some kind of locking is needed here (for instance using [`SETNX`](../setnx)).\n\n## Using hashes in `BY` and `GET`\n\nIt is possible to use `BY` and `GET` options against hash fields with the following syntax:\n\n```\nSORT mylist BY weight_*->fieldname GET object_*->fieldname\n```\n\nThe string `->` is used to separate the key name from the hash field name. The key is substituted as documented above, and the hash stored at the resulting key is accessed to retrieve the specified hash field.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): without passing the `store` option the command returns a list of sorted elements. [Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): when the `store` option is specified the command returns the number of sorted elements in the destination list.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/sort/](https://redis.io/commands/sort/)"

Once a non empty bucket is found, since we use chaining in our hash table implementation, the number of elements inside the bucket is checked and a random element is selected.\n\nThis means that if you have two non-empty buckets in the entire hash table, and one has three elements while one has just one, the element that is alone in its bucket will be returned with much higher probability.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 2.6.0: Added the optional `count` argument.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/srandmember/](https://redis.io/commands/srandmember/)"

The double number should follow [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) (JSON standard). In particular, the parser rejects overly large values that do not fit in binary64. It does not accept NaN or infinite values.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- When specified key does not exist, a new time series is created.\n\n  if a [COMPACTION_POLICY](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries/configuration/#compaction_policy) configuration parameter is defined, compacted time series would be created as well.\n\n- If `timestamp` is older than the retention period compared to the maximum existing timestamp, the sample is discarded and an error is returned.\n\n- When adding a sample to a time series for which compaction rules are defined:\n\n  - If all the original samples for an affected aggregated time bucket are available, the compacted value is recalculated based on the reported sample and the original samples.\n  - If only a part of the original samples for an affected aggregated time bucket is available due to trimming caused in accordance with the time series RETENTION policy, the compacted value is recalculated based on the reported sample and the available original samples.\n  - If the original samples for an affected aggregated time bucket are not available due to trimming caused in accordance with the time series RETENTION policy, the compacted value bucket is not updated.\n\n- Explicitly adding samples to a compacted time series (using `TS.ADD`, [`TS.MADD`](../ts.madd), [`TS.INCRBY`](../ts.incrby), or [`TS.DECRBY`](../ts.decrby)) may result in inconsistencies between the raw and the compacted data. The compaction process may override such samples.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\nThe following arguments are optional because they can be set by [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n`RETENTION retentionPeriod`\n\nis maximum retention period, compared to the maximum existing timestamp, in milliseconds.\n\nUse it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `RETENTION` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n`ENCODING enc`\n\nspecifies the series sample's encoding format.\n\nUse it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `ENCODING` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n`CHUNK_SIZE size` is memory size, in bytes, allocated for each data chunk.\n\nUse it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `CHUNK_SIZE` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n`ON_DUPLICATE policy`\n\nis overwrite key and database configuration for [DUPLICATE_POLICY](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries/configuration/#duplicate_policy), the policy for handling samples with identical timestamps. It is used with one of the following values:\n\n- `BLOCK`: ignore any newly reported value and reply with an error\n- `FIRST`: ignore any newly reported value\n- `LAST`: override with the newly reported value\n- `MIN`: only override if the value is lower than the existing value\n- `MAX`: only override if the value is higher than the existing value\n- `SUM`: If a previous sample exists, add the new sample to it so that the updated value is equal to (previous + new). If no previous sample exists, set the updated value equal to the new value.\n\n`LABELS {label value}...`\n\nis set of label-value pairs that represent metadata labels of the time series.\n\nUse it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `LABELS` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- You can use this command to add data to a nonexisting time series in a single command. This is why `RETENTION`, `ENCODING`, `CHUNK_SIZE`, `ON_DUPLICATE`, and `LABELS` are optional arguments.\n- Setting `RETENTION` and `LABELS` introduces additional time complexity.\n\n## Return value\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers) - the timestamp of the upserted sample, or [Error reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-errors).\n\n## Complexity\n\nIf a compaction rule exits on a time series, the performance of `TS.ADD` can be reduced. The complexity of `TS.ADD` is always `O(M)`, where `M` is the number of compaction rules or `O(1)` with no compaction.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Append a sample to a temperature time series**\n\nCreate a temperature time series, set its retention to 1 year, and append a sample.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.ADD temperature:3:11 1548149183000 27 RETENTION 31536000000\n(integer) 1548149183000\n```\n\n**Note:** If a time series with such a name already exists, the sample is added, but the retention does not change.\n\nAdd a sample to the time series, setting the sample's timestamp according to the server clock.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.ADD temperature:3:11 * 30\n(integer) 1662042954573\n```\n\n## See also\n\n[`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create)\n\n## Related topics\n\n[RedisTimeSeries](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/ts.add/](https://redis.io/commands/ts.add/)"

You can check for the existence of a key with the [`EXISTS`](../exists) command.\n- Other commands that also create a new time series when called with a key that does not exist are [`TS.ADD`](../ts.add), [`TS.INCRBY`](../ts.incrby), and [`TS.DECRBY`](../ts.decrby).\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`RETENTION retentionPeriod`\n\nis maximum age for samples compared to the highest reported timestamp, in milliseconds. Samples are expired based solely on the difference between their timestamp and the timestamps passed to subsequent [`TS.ADD`](../ts.add), [`TS.MADD`](../ts.madd), [`TS.INCRBY`](../ts.incrby), and [`TS.DECRBY`](../ts.decrby) calls with this key.\n\nWhen set to 0, samples never expire. When not specified, the option is set to the global [RETENTION_POLICY](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries/configuration/#retention_policy) configuration of the database, which by default is 0.\n\n`ENCODING enc`\n\nspecifies the series samples encoding format as one of the following values:\n\n- `COMPRESSED`, applies compression to the series samples.\n- `UNCOMPRESSED`, keeps the raw samples in memory. Adding this flag keeps data in an uncompressed form.\n\n`COMPRESSED` is almost always the right choice. Compression not only saves memory but usually improves performance due to a lower number of memory accesses. It can result in about 90% memory reduction. The exception are highly irregular timestamps or values, which occur rarely.\n\nWhen not specified, the option is set to `COMPRESSED`.\n\n`CHUNK_SIZE size`\n\nis initial allocation size, in bytes, for the data part of each new chunk. Actual chunks may consume more memory. Changing chunkSize (using [`TS.ALTER`](../ts.alter)) does not affect existing chunks.\n\nMust be a multiple of 8 in the range \\[48 .. 1048576\\]. When not specified, it is set to the global [CHUNK_SIZE_BYTES](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries/configuration/#chunk_size_bytes) configuration of the database, which by default is 4096 (a single memory page).\n\nNote: Before v1.6.10 no minimum was enforced. Between v1.6.10 and v1.6.17 and in v1.8.0 the minimum value was 128. Since v1.8.1 the minimum value is 48.\n\nThe data in each key is stored in chunks. Each chunk contains header and data for a given timeframe. An index contains all chunks. Iterations occur inside each chunk. Depending on your use case, consider these tradeoffs for having smaller or larger sizes of chunks:\n\n- Insert performance: Smaller chunks result in slower inserts (more chunks need to be created).\n- Query performance: Queries for a small subset when the chunks are very large are slower, as we need to iterate over the chunk to find the data.\n- Larger chunks may take more memory when you have a very large number of keys and very few samples per key, or less memory when you have many samples per key.\n\nIf you are unsure about your use case, select the default.\n\n`DUPLICATE_POLICY policy`\n\nis policy for handling insertion ([`TS.ADD`](../ts.add) and [`TS.MADD`](../ts.madd)) of multiple samples with identical timestamps, with one of the following values:\n\n- `BLOCK`: ignore any newly reported value and reply with an error\n- `FIRST`: ignore any newly reported value\n- `LAST`: override with the newly reported value\n- `MIN`: only override if the value is lower than the existing value\n- `MAX`: only override if the value is higher than the existing value\n- `SUM`: If a previous sample exists, add the new sample to it so that the updated value is equal to (previous + new). If no previous sample exists, set the updated value equal to the new value.\n\nWhen not specified: set to the global [DUPLICATE_POLICY](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries/configuration/#duplicate_policy) configuration of the database (which, by default, is `BLOCK`).\n\n`LABELS {label value}...`\n\nis set of label-value pairs that represent metadata labels of the key and serve as a secondary index.\n\nThe [`TS.MGET`](../ts.mget), [`TS.MRANGE`](../ts.mrange), and [`TS.MREVRANGE`](../ts.mrevrange) commands operate on multiple time series based on their labels. The [`TS.QUERYINDEX`](../ts.queryindex) command returns all time series keys matching a given filter based on their labels.\n\n## Return value\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings) - `OK` if executed correctly, or [Error reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-errors) otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Create a temperature time series**\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE temperature:2:32 RETENTION 60000 DUPLICATE_POLICY MAX LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\nOK\n```\n\n## See also\n\n[`TS.ADD`](../ts.add) \\| [`TS.INCRBY`](../ts.incrby) \\| [`TS.DECRBY`](../ts.decrby) \\| [`TS.MGET`](../ts.mget) \\| [`TS.MRANGE`](../ts.mrange) \\| [`TS.MREVRANGE`](../ts.mrevrange) \\| [`TS.QUERYINDEX`](../ts.queryindex)\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [RedisTimeSeries](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n- [RedisTimeSeries Version 1.2 Is Here!](https://redis.com/blog/redistimeseries-version-1-2-is-here/)\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/ts.create/](https://redis.io/commands/ts.create/)"

For example, for a 10-minute compaction bucket with no alignment, the compacted samples timestamps are `x:00`, `x:10`, `x:20`, and so on.\n- Deleting `destKey` will cause the compaction rule to be deleted as well.\n- On a clustered environment, hash tags should be used to force `sourceKey` and `destKey` to be stored in the same hash slot.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`alignTimestamp` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)\n\nensures that there is a bucket that starts exactly at `alignTimestamp` and aligns all other buckets accordingly. It is expressed in milliseconds. The default value is 0 aligned with the epoch. For example, if `bucketDuration` is 24 hours (`24 * 3600 * 1000`), setting `alignTimestamp` to 6 hours after the epoch (`6 * 3600 * 1000`) ensures that each bucket’s timeframe is `[06:00 .. 06:00)`.\n\n## Return value\n\n[Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings) - `OK` if executed correctly, or [Error reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-errors) otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Create a compaction rule**\n\nCreate a time series to store the temperatures measured in Tel Aviv.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE temp:TLV LABELS type temp location TLV\nOK\n```\n\nNext, create a compacted time series named *dailyAvgTemp* containing one compacted sample per 24 hours: the time-weighted average of all measurements taken from midnight to next midnight.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE dailyAvgTemp:TLV LABELS type temp location TLV\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATERULE temp:TLV dailyAvgTemp:TLV AGGREGATION twa 86400000 \n```\n\nNow, also create a compacted time series named *dailyDiffTemp*.

  description: "# TS.INCRBY\n\n    TS.INCRBY\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nTS.INCRBY key value \n  [TIMESTAMP timestamp] \n  [RETENTION retentionPeriod] \n  [UNCOMPRESSED] \n  [CHUNK_SIZE size] \n  [LABELS {label value}...]\n```\n\nAvailable in:  \n[Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack) / [TimeSeries 1.0.0](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(M) when M is the amount of compaction rules or O(1) with no compaction\n\nIncrease the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp, or create a new sample with a value equal to the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp with a given increment\n\n[Examples](#examples)\n\n## Required arguments\n\n`key`\n\nis key name for the time series.\n\n`value`\n\nis numeric data value of the sample (double)\n\n**Notes**\n\n- When specified key does not exist, a new time series is created.\n- You can use this command as a counter or gauge that automatically gets history as a time series.\n- Explicitly adding samples to a compacted time series (using [`TS.ADD`](../ts.add), [`TS.MADD`](../ts.madd), `TS.INCRBY`, or [`TS.DECRBY`](../ts.decrby)) may result in inconsistencies between the raw and the compacted data. The compaction process may override such samples.  \n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`TIMESTAMP timestamp`\n\nis (integer) UNIX sample timestamp in milliseconds or `*` to set the timestamp according to the server clock.\n\n`timestamp` must be equal to or higher than the maximum existing timestamp. When equal, the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp is increased. If it is higher, a new sample with a timestamp set to `timestamp` is created, and its value is set to the value of the sample with the maximum existing timestamp plus `value`.\n\nIf the time series is empty, the value is set to `value`.\n\nWhen not specified, the timestamp is set according to the server clock.\n\n`RETENTION retentionPeriod`\n\nis maximum retention period, compared to the maximum existing timestamp, in milliseconds. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `RETENTION` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n`UNCOMPRESSED`\n\nchanges data storage from compressed (default) to uncompressed. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `ENCODING` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n`CHUNK_SIZE size`\n\nis memory size, in bytes, allocated for each data chunk. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `CHUNK_SIZE` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n`LABELS [{label value}...]`\n\nis set of label-value pairs that represent metadata labels of the key and serve as a secondary index. Use it only if you are creating a new time series. It is ignored if you are adding samples to an existing time series. See `LABELS` in [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create).\n\n**Notes**\n\n- You can use this command to add data to a nonexisting time series in a single command. This is why `RETENTION`, `UNCOMPRESSED`, `CHUNK_SIZE`, and `LABELS` are optional arguments.\n- When specified and the key doesn't exist, a new time series is created. Setting the `RETENTION` and `LABELS` introduces additional time complexity.\n\n## Return value\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers) - the timestamp of the upserted sample, or [Error reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-errors).\n\n## Examples\n\n**Store sum of data from several sources**\n\nSuppose you are getting number of orders or total income per minute from several points of sale, and you want to store only the combined value. Call TS.INCRBY for each point-of-sale report.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.INCRBY a 232 TIMESTAMP 1657811829000      // point-of-sale #1\n(integer) 1657811829000\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.INCRBY a 157 TIMESTAMP 1657811829000     // point-of-sale #2\n(integer) 1657811829000\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.INCRBY a 432 TIMESTAMP 1657811829000     // point-of-sale #3\n(integer) 1657811829000\n```\n\nNote that the timestamps must arrive in non-decreasing order.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> ts.incrby a 100 TIMESTAMP 50\n(error) TSDB: timestamp must be equal to or higher than the maximum existing timestamp\n```\n\nYou can achieve similar results without such protection using `TS.ADD key timestamp value ON_DUPLICATE sum`.\n\n**Count sensor captures**\n\nSupose a sensor ticks whenever a car is passed on a road, and you want to count occurrences. Whenever you get a tick from the sensor you can simply call:\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.INCRBY a 1\n(integer) 1658431553109\n```\n\nThe timestamp is filled automatically.\n\n## See also\n\n[`TS.DECRBY`](../ts.decrby) \\| [`TS.CREATE`](../ts.create)\n\n## Related topics\n\n[RedisTimeSeries](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/ts.incrby/](https://redis.io/commands/ts.incrby/)"

  summary: is the key name for the time series
  description: "# TS.MADD\n\n    TS.MADD\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nTS.MADD {key timestamp value}...\n```\n\nAvailable in:  \n[Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack) / [TimeSeries 1.0.0](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N\\*M) when N is the amount of series updated and M is the amount of compaction rules or O(N) with no compaction\n\nAppend new samples to one or more time series\n\n[Examples](#examples)\n\n## Required arguments\n\n`key`\n\nis the key name for the time series.\n\n`timestamp`\n\nis (integer) UNIX sample timestamp in milliseconds or `*` to set the timestamp according to the server clock.\n\n`value`\n\nis numeric data value of the sample (double). The double number should follow [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) (a JSON standard). The parser rejects overly large values that would not fit in binary64. It does not accept NaN or infinite values.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- If `timestamp` is older than the retention period compared to the maximum existing timestamp, the sample is discarded and an error is returned.\n- Explicitly adding samples to a compacted time series (using [`TS.ADD`](../ts.add), `TS.MADD`, [`TS.INCRBY`](../ts.incrby), or [`TS.DECRBY`](../ts.decrby)) may result in inconsistencies between the raw and the compacted data. The compaction process may override such samples.\n\n## Return value\n\nEither\n\n- [Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays) of [Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers) representing the timestamp of each added sample or an [Error reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-errors) (e.g., on `DUPLICATE_POLICY` violation)\n- [Error reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-errors) (e.g., on wrong number of arguments)\n\n## Complexity\n\nIf a compaction rule exits on a time series, TS.MADD performance might be reduced. The complexity of TS.MADD is always `O(N*M)`, where `N` is the amount of series updated and `M` is the amount of compaction rules or `O(N)` with no compaction.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Add stock prices at different timestamps**\n\nCreate two stocks and add their prices at three different timestamps.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE stock:A LABELS type stock name A\nOK\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE stock:B LABELS type stock name B\nOK\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.MADD stock:A 1000 100 stock:A 1010 110 stock:A 1020 120 stock:B 1000 120 stock:B 1010 110 stock:B 1020 100\n1) (integer) 1000\n2) (integer) 1010\n3) (integer) 1020\n4) (integer) 1000\n5) (integer) 1010\n6) (integer) 1020\n```\n\n## See also\n\n[`TS.MRANGE`](../ts.mrange) \\| [`TS.RANGE`](../ts.range) \\| [`TS.MREVRANGE`](../ts.mrevrange) \\| [`TS.REVRANGE`](../ts.revrange)\n\n## Related topics\n\n[RedisTimeSeries](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/ts.madd/](https://redis.io/commands/ts.madd/)"

For example, the FILTER `type=temperature room=study` means the a time series is a temperature time series of a study room.\n- Don't use whitespaces in the filter expression.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`LATEST` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)\n\nis used when a time series is a compaction. With `LATEST`, TS.MGET also reports the compacted value of the latest possibly partial bucket, given that this bucket's start time falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`. Without `LATEST`, TS.MGET does not report the latest possibly partial bucket. When a time series is not a compaction, `LATEST` is ignored.\n\nThe data in the latest bucket of a compaction is possibly partial. A bucket is *closed* and compacted only upon arrival of a new sample that *opens* a new *latest* bucket. There are cases, however, when the compacted value of the latest possibly partial bucket is also required. In such a case, use `LATEST`.\n\n`WITHLABELS`\n\nincludes in the reply all label-value pairs representing metadata labels of the time series. If `WITHLABELS` or `SELECTED_LABELS` are not specified, by default, an empty list is reported as label-value pairs.\n\n`SELECTED_LABELS label...` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nreturns a subset of the label-value pairs that represent metadata labels of the time series. Use when a large number of labels exists per series, but only the values of some of the labels are required. If `WITHLABELS` or `SELECTED_LABELS` are not specified, by default, an empty list is reported as label-value pairs.\n\n**Note:** The [`MGET`](../mget) command cannot be part of transaction when running on a Redis cluster.\n\n## Return value\n\n- [Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): for each time series matching the specified filters, the following is reported:\n  - bulk-string-reply: The time series key name\n  - [Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): label-value pairs ([Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings), [Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings))\n    - By default, an empty array is reported\n    - If `WITHLABELS` is specified, all labels associated with this time series are reported\n    - If `SELECTED_LABELS label...` is specified, the selected labels are reported (null value when no such label defined)\n  - [Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): a single timestamp-value pair ([Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers), [Simple string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings) (double))\n\n## Examples\n\n**Select labels to retrieve**\n\nCreate time series for temperature in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, then add different temperature samples.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE temp:TLV LABELS type temp location TLV\nOK\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.CREATE temp:JLM LABELS type temp location JLM\nOK\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.MADD temp:TLV 1000 30 temp:TLV 1010 35 temp:TLV 1020 9999 temp:TLV 1030 40\n1) (integer) 1000\n2) (integer) 1010\n3) (integer) 1020\n4) (integer) 1030\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.MADD temp:JLM 1005 30 temp:JLM 1015 35 temp:JLM 1025 9999 temp:JLM 1035 40\n1) (integer) 1005\n2) (integer) 1015\n3) (integer) 1025\n4) (integer) 1035\n```\n\nGet all the labels associated with the last sample.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.MGET WITHLABELS FILTER type=temp\n1) 1) \"temp:JLM\"\n   2) 1) 1) \"type\"\n         2) \"temp\"\n      2) 1) \"location\"\n         2) \"JLM\"\n   3) 1) (integer) 1035\n      2) 40\n2) 1) \"temp:TLV\"\n   2) 1) 1) \"type\"\n         2) \"temp\"\n      2) 1) \"location\"\n         2) \"TLV\"\n   3) 1) (integer) 1030\n      2) 40\n```\n\nTo get only the `location` label for each last sample, use `SELECTED_LABELS`.\n\n``` chroma\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.MGET SELECTED_LABELS location FILTER type=temp\n1) 1) \"temp:JLM\"\n   2) 1) 1) \"location\"\n         2) \"JLM\"\n   3) 1) (integer) 1035\n      2) 40\n2) 1) \"temp:TLV\"\n   2) 1) 1) \"location\"\n         2) \"TLV\"\n   3) 1) (integer) 1030\n      2) 40\n```\n\n## See also\n\n[`TS.MRANGE`](../ts.mrange) \\| [`TS.RANGE`](../ts.range) \\| [`TS.MREVRANGE`](../ts.mrevrange) \\| [`TS.REVRANGE`](../ts.revrange)\n\n## Related topics\n\n[RedisTimeSeries](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/ts.mget/](https://redis.io/commands/ts.mget/)"

With `LATEST`, TS.MRANGE also reports the compacted value of the latest possibly partial bucket, given that this bucket's start time falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`. Without `LATEST`, TS.MRANGE does not report the latest possibly partial bucket.

Use when a large number of labels exists per series, but only the values of some of the labels are required. If `WITHLABELS` or `SELECTED_LABELS` are not specified, by default, an empty list is reported as label-value pairs.\n\n`COUNT count`\n\nlimits the number of returned samples.\n\n`ALIGN align` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nis a time bucket alignment control for `AGGREGATION`. It controls the time bucket timestamps by changing the reference timestamp on which a bucket is defined.\n\nValues include:\n\n- `start` or `-`: The reference timestamp will be the query start interval time (`fromTimestamp`) which can't be `-`\n- `end` or `+`: The reference timestamp will be the query end interval time (`toTimestamp`) which can't be `+`\n- A specific timestamp: align the

  summary: filters time series based on their labels and label values
  description: "# TS.MREVRANGE\n\n    TS.MREVRANGE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nTS.MREVRANGE fromTimestamp toTimestamp\n  [LATEST]\n  [FILTER_BY_TS TS...]\n  [FILTER_BY_VALUE min max]\n  [WITHLABELS | SELECTED_LABELS label...]\n  [COUNT count]\n  [[ALIGN align] AGGREGATION aggregator bucketDuration [BUCKETTIMESTAMP bt] [EMPTY]]\n  FILTER filterExpr...\n  [GROUPBY label REDUCE reducer]\n```\n\nAvailable in:  \n[Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack) / [TimeSeries 1.4.0](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(n/m+k) where n = Number of data points, m = Chunk size (data points per chunk), k = Number of data points that are in the requested ranges\n\nQuery a range across multiple time series by filters in reverse direction\n\n[Examples](#examples)\n\n## Required arguments\n\n`fromTimestamp`\n\nis start timestamp for the range query (integer UNIX timestamp in milliseconds) or `-` to denote the timestamp of the earliest sample amongs all time series that passes `FILTER filterExpr...`.\n\n`toTimestamp`\n\nis end timestamp for the range query (integer UNIX timestamp in milliseconds) or `+` to denote the timestamp of the latest sample amongs all time series that passes `FILTER filterExpr...`.\n\n`FILTER filterExpr...`\n\nfilters time series based on their labels and label values. Each filter expression has one of the following syntaxes:\n\n- `label=value`, where `label` equals `value`\n- `label!=value`, where `label` does not equal `value`\n- `label=`, where `key` does not have label `label`\n- `label!=`, where `key` has label `label`\n- `label=(value1,value2,...)`, where `key` with label `label` equals one of the values in the list\n- `label!=(value1,value2,...)`, where key with label `label` does not equal any of the values in the list\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- At least one `label=value` filter is required.\n- Filters are conjunctive. For example, the FILTER `type=temperature room=study` means the a time series is a temperature time series of a study room.\n- Don't use whitespaces in the filter expression.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`LATEST` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)\n\nis used when a time series is a compaction. With `LATEST`, TS.MREVRANGE also reports the compacted value of the latest possibly partial bucket, given that this bucket's start time falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`. Without `LATEST`, TS.MREVRANGE does not report the latest possibly partial bucket. When a time series is not a compaction, `LATEST` is ignored.\n\nThe data in the latest bucket of a compaction is possibly partial. A bucket is *closed* and compacted only upon arrival of a new sample that *opens* a new *latest* bucket. There are cases, however, when the compacted value of the latest possibly partial bucket is also required. In such a case, use `LATEST`.\n\n`FILTER_BY_TS ts...` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nfilters samples by a list of specific timestamps. A sample passes the filter if its exact timestamp is specified and falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`.\n\n`FILTER_BY_VALUE min max` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nfilters samples by minimum and maximum values.\n\n`WITHLABELS`\n\nincludes in the reply all label-value pairs representing metadata labels of the time series. If `WITHLABELS` or `SELECTED_LABELS` are not specified, by default, an empty list is reported as label-value pairs.\n\n`SELECTED_LABELS label...` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nreturns a subset of the label-value pairs that represent metadata labels of the time series. Use when a large number of labels exists per series, but only the values of some of the labels are required. If `WITHLABELS` or `SELECTED_LABELS` are not specified, by default, an empty list is reported as label-value pairs.\n\n`COUNT count`\n\nlimits the number of returned samples.\n\n`ALIGN align` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nis a time bucket alignment control for `AGGREGATION`. It controls the time bucket timestamps by changing the reference timestamp on which a bucket is defined.\n\nValues include:\n\n- `start` or `-`: The reference timestamp will be the query start interval time (`fromTimestamp`) which can't be `-`\n- `end` or `+`: The reference timestamp will be the query end interval time (`toTimestamp`) which can't be `+`\n- A specific timestamp: align the reference timestamp to a specific time\n\n**Note:** When not provided, alignment is set to `0`.\n\n`AGGREGATION aggregator bucketDuration`\n\nper time series, aggregates samples into time buckets, where:\n\n- `aggregator` takes one of the following aggregation types:\n\n  | `aggregator` | Description                                                                    |\n

v1.8) |\n\n- `bucketDuration` is duration of each bucket, in milliseconds.\n\nWithout `ALIGN`, bucket start times are multiples of `bucketDuration`.\n\nWith `ALIGN align`, bucket start times are multiples of `bucketDuration` with remainder `align % bucketDuration`.\n\nThe first bucket start time is less than or equal to `fromTimestamp`.\n\n`[BUCKETTIMESTAMP bt]` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)\n\ncontrols how bucket timestamps are reported.\n\n| `bt`          | Timestamp reported for each bucket                     |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `-` or `low`  | the bucket's start time (default)                      |\n| `+` or `high` | the bucket's end time                                  |\n| `~` or `mid`  | the bucket's mid time (rounded down if not an integer) |\n\n`[EMPTY]` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)\n\nis a flag, which, when specified, reports aggregations also for empty buckets.\n\n| `aggregator`                                            | Value reported for each empty bucket

That is because `toTimestamp` only limits the timestamp of the compacted value, which is the start time of the raw bucket that was compacted.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`LATEST` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)\n\nis used when a time series is a compaction. With `LATEST`, TS.RANGE also reports the compacted value of the latest, possibly partial, bucket, given that this bucket's start time falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`. Without `LATEST`, TS.RANGE does not report the latest, possibly partial, bucket. When a time series is not a compaction, `LATEST` is ignored.\n\nThe data in the latest bucket of a compaction is possibly partial. A bucket is *closed* and compacted only upon arrival of a new sample that *opens* a new *latest* bucket. There are cases, however, when the compacted value of the latest, possibly partial, bucket is also required. In such a case, use `LATEST`.\n\n`FILTER_BY_TS ts...` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nfilters samples by a list of specific timestamps. A sample passes the filter if its exact timestamp is specified and falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`.\n\n`FILTER_BY_VALUE min max` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nfilters samples by minimum and maximum values.\n\n`COUNT count`\n\nlimits the number of returned samples.\n\n`ALIGN align` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nis a time bucket alignment control for `AGGREGATION`. It controls the time bucket timestamps by changing the reference timestamp on which a bucket is defined.\n\n`align` values include:\n\n- `start` or `-`: The reference timestamp will be the query start interval time (`fromTimestamp`) which can't be `-`\n- `end` or `+`: The reference timestamp will be the query end interval time (`toTimestamp`) which can't be `+`\n- A specific timestamp: align the reference timestamp to a specific time\n\n**Note:** When not provided, alignment is set to `0`.\n\n`AGGREGATION aggregator bucketDuration`\n\naggregates samples into time buckets, where:\n\n- `aggregator` takes one of the following aggregation types:\n\n  | `aggregator` | Description                                                                    |\n

  |\n  | `last`       | Value with highest timestamp in the bucket                                     |\n  | `std.p`      | Population standard deviation of the values                                    |\n  | `std.s`      | Sample standard deviation of the values                                        |\n  | `var.p`      | Population variance of the values

  description: "# TS.REVRANGE\n\n    TS.REVRANGE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nTS.REVRANGE key fromTimestamp toTimestamp\n  [LATEST]\n  [FILTER_BY_TS TS...]\n  [FILTER_BY_VALUE min max]\n  [COUNT count]\n  [[ALIGN align] AGGREGATION aggregator bucketDuration [BUCKETTIMESTAMP bt] [EMPTY]]\n```\n\nAvailable in:  \n[Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack) / [TimeSeries 1.4.0](https://redis.io/docs/stack/timeseries)\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(n/m+k) where n = Number of data points, m = Chunk size (data points per chunk), k = Number of data points that are in the requested range\n\nQuery a range in reverse direction\n\n[Examples](#examples)\n\n## Required arguments\n\n`key`\n\nis the key name for the time series.\n\n`fromTimestamp`\n\nis start timestamp for the range query (integer UNIX timestamp in milliseconds) or `-` to denote the timestamp of the earliest sample in the time series.\n\n`toTimestamp`\n\nis end timestamp for the range query (integer UNIX timestamp in milliseconds) or `+` to denote the timestamp of the latest sample in the time series.\n\n**Note:** When the time series is a compaction, the last compacted value may aggregate raw values with timestamp beyond `toTimestamp`. That is because `toTimestamp` limits only the timestamp of the compacted value, which is the start time of the raw bucket that was compacted.\n\n## Optional arguments\n\n`LATEST` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.8)\n\nis used when a time series is a compaction. With `LATEST`, TS.REVRANGE also reports the compacted value of the latest, possibly partial, bucket, given that this bucket's start time falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`. Without `LATEST`, TS.REVRANGE does not report the latest, possibly partial, bucket. When a time series is not a compaction, `LATEST` is ignored.\n\nThe data in the latest bucket of a compaction is possibly partial. A bucket is *closed* and compacted only upon arrival of a new sample that *opens* a new *latest* bucket. There are cases, however, when the compacted value of the latest, possibly partial, bucket is also required. In such a case, use `LATEST`.\n\n`FILTER_BY_TS ts...` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nfilters samples by a list of specific timestamps. A sample passes the filter if its exact timestamp is specified and falls within `[fromTimestamp, toTimestamp]`.\n\n`FILTER_BY_VALUE min max` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nfilters samples by minimum and maximum values.\n\n`COUNT count` limits the number of returned samples.\n\n`ALIGN align` (since RedisTimeSeries v1.6)\n\nis a time bucket alignment control for `AGGREGATION`. It controls the time bucket timestamps by changing the reference timestamp on which a bucket is defined. Values include:\n\n- `start` or `-`: The reference timestamp will be the query start interval time (`fromTimestamp`) which can't be `-`\n- `end` or `+`: The reference timestamp will be the query end interval time (`toTimestamp`) which can't be `+`\n- A specific timestamp: align the reference timestamp to a specific time\n\n**NOTE:** When not provided, alignment is set to `0`.\n\n`AGGREGATION aggregator bucketDuration` aggregates samples into time buckets, where:\n\n- `aggregator` takes one of the following aggregation types:\n\n  | `aggregator` | Description

If the timeout, specified in milliseconds, is reached, the command returns even if the specified number of replicas were not yet reached.\n\nThe command **will always return** the number of replicas that acknowledged the write commands sent by the current client before the `WAIT` command, both in the case where the specified number of replicas are reached, or when the timeout is reached.\n\nA few remarks:\n\n1.  When `WAIT` returns, all the previous write commands sent in the context of the current connection are guaranteed to be received by the number of replicas returned by `WAIT`.\n2.  If the command is sent as part of a [`MULTI`](../multi) transaction (since Redis 7.0, any context that does not allow blocking, such as inside scripts), the command does not block but instead just return ASAP the number of replicas that acknowledged the previous write commands.\n3.  A timeout of 0 means to block forever.\n4.  Since `WAIT` returns the number of replicas reached both in case of failure and success, the client should check that the returned value is equal or greater to the replication level it demanded.\n\n## Consistency and WAIT\n\nNote that `WAIT` does not make Redis a strongly consistent store: while synchronous replication is part of a replicated state machine, it is not the only thing needed. However in the context of Sentinel or Redis Cluster failover, `WAIT` improves the real world data safety.\n\nSpecifically if a given write is transferred to one or more replicas, it is more likely (but not guaranteed) that if the master fails, we'll be able to promote, during a failover, a replica that received the write: both Sentinel and Redis Cluster will do a best-effort attempt to promote the best replica among the set of available replicas.\n\nHowever this is just a best-effort attempt so it is possible to still lose a write synchronously replicated to multiple replicas.\n\n## Implementation details\n\nSince the introduction of partial resynchronization with replicas (PSYNC feature) Redis replicas asynchronously ping their master with the offset they already processed in the replication stream. This is used in multiple ways:\n\n1.  Detect timed out replicas.\n2.  Perform a partial resynchronization after a disconnection.\n3.  Implement `WAIT`.\n\nIn the specific case of the implementation of `WAIT`, Redis remembers, for each client, the replication offset of the produced replication stream when a given write command was executed in the context of a given client. When `WAIT` is called Redis checks if the specified number of replicas already acknowledged this offset or a greater one.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): The command returns the number of replicas reached by all the writes performed in the context of the current connection.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n> SET foo bar\nOK\n> WAIT 1 0\n(integer) 1\n> WAIT 2 1000\n(integer) 1\n```\n\nIn the following example the first call to `WAIT` does not use a timeout and asks for the write to reach 1 replica. It returns with success. In the second attempt instead we put a timeout, and ask for the replication of the write to two replicas. Since there is a single replica available, after one second `WAIT` unblocks and returns 1, the number of replicas reached.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/wait/](https://redis.io/commands/wait/)"

So new calls to [`XREADGROUP`](../xreadgroup) to grab the messages history for a consumer (for instance using an ID of 0), will return such message.

If the key does not exist, as a side effect of running this command the key is created with a stream value. The creation of stream's key can be disabled with the `NOMKSTREAM` option.\n\nAn entry is composed of a list of field-value pairs. The field-value pairs are stored in the same order they are given by the user. Commands that read the stream, such as [`XRANGE`](../xrange) or [`XREAD`](../xread), are guaranteed to return the fields and values exactly in the same order they were added by `XADD`.\n\n`XADD` is the *only Redis command* that can add data to a stream, but there are other commands, such as [`XDEL`](../xdel) and [`XTRIM`](../xtrim), that are able to remove data from a stream.\n\n## Specifying a Stream ID as an argument\n\nA stream entry ID identifies a given entry inside a stream.\n\nThe `XADD` command will auto-generate a unique ID for you if the ID argument specified is the `*` character (asterisk ASCII character). However, while useful only in very rare cases, it is possible to specify a well-formed ID, so that the new entry will be added exactly with the specified ID.\n\nIDs are specified by two numbers separated by a `-` character:\n\n    1526919030474-55\n\nBoth quantities are 64-bit numbers. When an ID is auto-generated, the first part is the Unix time in milliseconds of the Redis instance generating the ID. The second part is just a sequence number and is used in order to distinguish IDs generated in the same millisecond.\n\nYou can also specify an incomplete ID, that consists only of the milliseconds part, which is interpreted as a zero value for sequence part. To have only the sequence part automatically generated, specify the milliseconds part followed by the `-` separator and the `*` character:\n\n```\n> XADD mystream 1526919030474-55 message \"Hello,\"\n\"1526919030474-55\"\n> XADD mystream 1526919030474-* message \" World!\"\n\"1526919030474-56\"\n```\n\nIDs are guaranteed to be always incremental: If you compare the ID of the entry just inserted it will be greater than any other past ID, so entries are totally ordered inside a stream. In order to guarantee this property, if the current top ID in the stream has a time greater than the current local time of the instance, the top entry time will be used instead, and the sequence part of the ID incremented. This may happen when, for instance, the local clock jumps backward, or if after a failover the new master has a different absolute time.\n\nWhen a user specified an explicit ID to `XADD`, the minimum valid ID is `0-1`, and the user *must* specify an ID which is greater than any other ID currently inside the stream, otherwise the command will fail and return an error. Usually resorting to specific IDs is useful only if you have another system generating unique IDs (for instance an SQL table) and you really want the Redis stream IDs to match the one of this other system.\n\n## Capped streams\n\n`XADD` incorporates the same semantics as the [`XTRIM`](../xtrim) command - refer to its documentation page for more information. This allows adding new entries and keeping the stream's size in check with a single call to `XADD`, effectively capping the stream with an arbitrary threshold. Although exact trimming is possible and is the default, due to the internal representation of steams it is more efficient to add an entry and trim stream with `XADD` using **almost exact** trimming (the `~` argument).\n\nFor example, calling `XADD` in the following form:\n\n    XADD mystream MAXLEN ~ 1000 * ... entry fields here ...\n\nWill add a new entry but will also evict old entries so that the stream will contain only 1000 entries, or at most a few tens more.\n\n## Additional information about streams\n\nFor further information about Redis streams please check our [introduction to Redis Streams document](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro).\n\n## Return\n\n[Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings), specifically:\n\nThe command returns the ID of the added entry.

  summary: 'Time complexity: O(1) if COUNT is small'
  description: "# XAUTOCLAIM\n\n    XAUTOCLAIM\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nXAUTOCLAIM key group consumer min-idle-time start [COUNT count]\n  [JUSTID]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n6.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(1) if COUNT is small.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@stream`, `@fast`,\n\nThis command transfers ownership of pending stream entries that match the specified criteria. Conceptually, `XAUTOCLAIM` is equivalent to calling [`XPENDING`](../xpending) and then [`XCLAIM`](../xclaim), but provides a more straightforward way to deal with message delivery failures via [`SCAN`](../scan)-like semantics.\n\nLike [`XCLAIM`](../xclaim), the command operates on the stream entries at `<key>` and in the context of the provided `<group>`. It transfers ownership to `<consumer>` of messages pending for more than `<min-idle-time>` milliseconds and having an equal or greater ID than `<start>`.\n\nThe optional `<count>` argument, which defaults to 100, is the upper limit of the number of entries that the command attempts to claim. Internally, the command begins scanning the consumer group's Pending Entries List (PEL) from `<start>` and filters out entries having an idle time less than or equal to `<min-idle-time>`. The maximum number of pending entries that the command scans is the product of multiplying `<count>`'s value by 10 (hard-coded). It is possible, therefore, that the number of entries claimed will be less than the specified value.\n\nThe optional `JUSTID` argument changes the reply to return just an array of IDs of messages successfully claimed, without returning the actual message. Using this option means the retry counter is not incremented.\n\nThe command returns the claimed entries as an array. It also returns a stream ID intended for cursor-like use as the `<start>` argument for its subsequent call. When there are no remaining PEL entries, the command returns the special `0-0` ID to signal completion. However, note that you may want to continue calling `XAUTOCLAIM` even after the scan is complete with the `0-0` as `<start>` ID, because enough time passed, so older pending entries may now be eligible for claiming.\n\nNote that only messages that are idle longer than `<min-idle-time>` are claimed, and claiming a message resets its idle time. This ensures that only a single consumer can successfully claim a given pending message at a specific instant of time and trivially reduces the probability of processing the same message multiple times.\n\nWhile iterating the PEL, if `XAUTOCLAIM` stumbles upon a message which doesn't exist in the stream anymore (either trimmed or deleted by [`XDEL`](../xdel)) it does not claim it, and deletes it from the PEL in which it was found. This feature was introduced in Redis 7.0. These message IDs are returned to the caller as a part of `XAUTOCLAIM`s reply.\n\nLastly, claiming a message with `XAUTOCLAIM` also increments the attempted deliveries count for that message, unless the `JUSTID` option has been specified (which only delivers the message ID, not the message itself). Messages that cannot be processed for some reason - for example, because consumers systematically crash when processing them - will exhibit high attempted delivery counts that can be detected by monitoring.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\nAn array with three elements:\n\n1.  A stream ID to be used as the `<start>` argument for the next call to `XAUTOCLAIM`.\n2.  An array containing all the successfully claimed messages in the same format as [`XRANGE`](../xrange).\n3.

Normally this is what happens:\n\n1.  There is a stream with an associated consumer group.\n2.  Some consumer A reads a message via [`XREADGROUP`](../xreadgroup) from a stream, in the context of that consumer group.\n3.  As a side effect a pending message entry is created in the Pending Entries List (PEL) of the consumer group: it means the message was delivered to a given consumer, but it was not yet acknowledged via [`XACK`](../xack).\n4.  Then suddenly that consumer fails forever.\n5.  Other consumers may inspect the list of pending messages, that are stale for quite some time, using the [`XPENDING`](../xpending) command. In order to continue processing such messages, they use `XCLAIM` to acquire the ownership of the message and continue. Consumers can also use the [`XAUTOCLAIM`](../xautoclaim) command to automatically scan and claim stale pending messages.\n\nThis dynamic is clearly explained in the [Stream intro documentation](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro).\n\nNote that the message is claimed only if its idle time is greater than the minimum idle time we specify when calling `XCLAIM`. Because as a side effect `XCLAIM` will also reset the idle time (since this is a new attempt at processing the message), two consumers trying to claim a message at the same time will never both succeed: only one will successfully claim the message. This avoids that we process a given message multiple times in a trivial way (yet multiple processing is possible and unavoidable in the general case).\n\nMoreover, as a side effect, `XCLAIM` will increment the count of attempted deliveries of the message unless the `JUSTID` option has been specified (which only delivers the message ID, not the message itself). In this way messages that cannot be processed for some reason, for instance because the consumers crash attempting to process them, will start to have a larger counter and can be detected inside the system.\n\n`XCLAIM` will not claim a message in the following cases:\n\n1.  The message doesn't exist in the group PEL (i.e. it was never read by any consumer)\n2.  The message exists in the group PEL but not in the stream itself (i.e. the message was read but never acknowledged, and then was deleted from the stream, either by trimming or by [`XDEL`](../xdel))\n\nIn both cases the reply will not contain a corresponding entry to that message (i.e. the length of the reply array may be smaller than the number of IDs provided to `XCLAIM`). In the latter case, the message will also be deleted from the PEL in which it was found. This feature was introduced in Redis 7.0.\n\n## Command options\n\nThe command has multiple options, however most are mainly for internal use in order to transfer the effects of `XCLAIM` or other commands to the AOF file and to propagate the same effects to the replicas, and are unlikely to be useful to normal users:\n\n1.  `IDLE <ms>`: Set the idle time (last time it was delivered) of the message. If IDLE is not specified, an IDLE of 0 is assumed, that is, the time count is reset because the message has now a new owner trying to process it.\n2.  `TIME <ms-unix-time>`: This is the same as IDLE but instead of a relative amount of milliseconds, it sets the idle time to a specific Unix time (in milliseconds). This is useful in order to rewrite the AOF file generating `XCLAIM` commands.\n3.  `RETRYCOUNT <count>`: Set the retry counter to the specified value. This counter is incremented every time a message is delivered again. Normally `XCLAIM` does not alter this counter, which is just served to clients when the XPENDING command is called: this way clients can detect anomalies, like messages that are never processed for some reason after a big number of delivery attempts.\n4.  `FORCE`: Creates the pending message entry in the PEL even if certain specified IDs are not already in the PEL assigned to a different client. However the message must be exist in the stream, otherwise the IDs of non existing messages are ignored.\n5.  `JUSTID`: Return just an array of IDs of messages successfully claimed, without returning the actual message. Using this option means the retry counter is not incremented.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\nThe command returns all the messages successfully claimed, in the same format as [`XRANGE`](../xrange). However if the `JUSTID` option was specified, only the message IDs are reported, without including the actual message.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n> XCLAIM mystream mygroup Alice 3600000 1526569498055-0\n1) 1) 1526569498055-0\n   2) 1) \"message\"\n      2) \"orange\"\n```\n\nIn the above example we claim the message with ID `1526569498055-0`, only if the message is idle for at least one hour without the original consumer or some other consumer making progresses (acknowledging or claiming it), and assigns the ownership to the consumer `Alice`.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xclaim/](https://redis.io/commands/xclaim/)"

This number may be less than the number of IDs passed to the command in the case where some of the specified IDs do not exist in the stream.\n\nNormally you may think at a Redis stream as an append-only data structure, however Redis streams are represented in memory, so we are also able to delete entries. This may be useful, for instance, in order to comply with certain privacy policies.\n\n## Understanding the low level details of entries deletion\n\nRedis streams are represented in a way that makes them memory efficient: a radix tree is used in order to index macro-nodes that pack linearly tens of stream entries. Normally what happens when you delete an entry from a stream is that the entry is not *really* evicted, it just gets marked as deleted.\n\nEventually if all the entries in a macro-node are marked as deleted, the whole node is destroyed and the memory reclaimed. This means that if you delete a large amount of entries from a stream, for instance more than 50% of the entries appended to the stream, the memory usage per entry may increment, since what happens is that the stream will become fragmented. However the stream performance will remain the same.\n\nIn future versions of Redis it is possible that we'll trigger a node garbage collection in case a given macro-node reaches a given amount of deleted entries. Currently with the usage we anticipate for this data structure, it is not a good idea to add such complexity.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): the number of entries actually deleted.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n> XADD mystream * a 1\n1538561698944-0\n> XADD mystream * b 2\n1538561700640-0\n> XADD mystream * c 3\n1538561701744-0\n> XDEL mystream 1538561700640-0\n(integer) 1\n127.0.0.1:6379> XRANGE mystream - +\n1) 1) 1538561698944-0\n   2) 1) \"a\"\n      2) \"1\"\n2) 1) 1538561701744-0\n   2) 1) \"c\"\n      2) \"3\"\n```\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xdel/](https://redis.io/commands/xdel/)"

Put differently, it is the number of entries that are yet to be delivered to the group's consumers.\n\nThe values and trends of this metric are helpful in making scaling decisions about the consumer group. You can address high lag values by adding more consumers to the group, whereas low values may indicate that you can remove consumers from the group to scale it down.\n\nRedis reports the lag of a consumer group by keeping two counters: the number of all entries added to the stream and the number of logical reads made by the consumer group. The lag is the difference between these two.\n\nThe stream's counter (the `entries_added` field of the [`XINFO STREAM`](../xinfo-stream) command) is incremented by one with every [`XADD`](../xadd) and counts all of the entries added to the stream during its lifetime.\n\nThe consumer group's counter, `entries_read`, is the logical counter of entries that the group had read. It is important to note that this counter is only a heuristic rather than an accurate counter, and therefore the use of the term \"logical\". The counter attempts to reflect the number of entries that the group **should have read** to get to its current `last-delivered-id`. The `entries_read` counter is accurate only in a perfect world, where a consumer group starts at the stream's first entry and processes all of its entries (i.e., no entries deleted before processing).\n\nThere are two special cases in which this mechanism is unable to report the lag:\n\n1.  A consumer group is created or set with an arbitrary last delivered ID (the [`XGROUP CREATE`](../xgroup-create) and [`XGROUP SETID`](../xgroup-setid) commands, respectively). An arbitrary ID is any ID that isn't the ID of the stream's first entry, its last entry or the zero (\"0-0\") ID.\n2.  One or more entries between the group's `last-delivered-id` and the stream's `last-generated-id` were deleted (with [`XDEL`](../xdel) or a trimming operation).\n\nIn both cases, the group's read counter is considered invalid, and the returned value is set to NULL to signal that the lag isn't currently available.\n\nHowever, the lag is only temporarily unavailable. It is restored automatically during regular operation as consumers keep processing messages. Once the consumer group delivers the last message in the stream to its members, it will be set with the correct logical read counter, and tracking its lag can be resumed.\n\n@reply\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): a list of consumer groups.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n> XINFO GROUPS mystream\n1)  1) \"name\"\n    2) \"mygroup\"\n    3) \"consumers\"\n    4) (integer) 2\n    5) \"pending\"\n    6) (integer) 2\n    7) \"last-delivered-id\"\n    8) \"1638126030001-0\"\n    9) \"entries-read\"\n   10) (integer) 2\n   11) \"lag\"\n   12) (integer) 0\n2)  1) \"name\"\n    2) \"some-other-group\"\n    3) \"consumers\"\n    4) (integer) 1\n    5) \"pending\"\n    6) (integer) 0\n    7) \"last-delivered-id\"\n    8) \"1638126028070-0\"\n    9) \"entries-read\"\n   10) (integer) 1\n   11) \"lag\"\n   12) (integer) 1\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added the `entries-read` and `lag` fields\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xinfo-groups/](https://redis.io/commands/xinfo-groups/)"

The default `COUNT` is 10 and a `COUNT` of 0 means that all entries will be returned (execution time may be long if the stream has a lot of entries).\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): a list of informational bits\n\n## Examples\n\nDefault reply:\n\n```\n> XINFO STREAM mystream\n 1) \"length\"\n 2) (integer) 2\n 3) \"radix-tree-keys\"\n 4) (integer) 1\n 5) \"radix-tree-nodes\"\n 6) (integer) 2\n 7) \"last-generated-id\"\n 8) \"1638125141232-0\"\n 9) \"max-deleted-entry-id\"\n10) \"0-0\"\n11) \"entries-added\"\n12) (integer) 2\n13) \"groups\"\n14) (integer) 1\n15) \"first-entry\"\n16) 1) \"1638125133432-0\"\n    2) 1) \"message\"\n       2) \"apple\"\n17) \"last-entry\"\n18) 1) \"1638125141232-0\"\n    2) 1) \"message\"\n       2) \"banana\"\n```\n\nFull reply:\n\n```\n> XADD mystream * foo bar\n\"1638125133432-0\"\n> XADD mystream * foo bar2\n\"1638125141232-0\"\n> XGROUP CREATE mystream mygroup 0-0\nOK\n> XREADGROUP GROUP mygroup Alice COUNT 1 STREAMS mystream >\n1) 1) \"mystream\"\n   2) 1) 1) \"1638125133432-0\"\n         2) 1) \"foo\"\n            2) \"bar\"\n> XINFO STREAM mystream FULL\n 1) \"length\"\n 2) (integer) 2\n 3) \"radix-tree-keys\"\n 4) (integer) 1\n 5) \"radix-tree-nodes\"\n 6) (integer) 2\n 7) \"last-generated-id\"\n 8) \"1638125141232-0\"\n 9) \"max-deleted-entry-id\"\n10) \"0-0\"\n11) \"entries-added\"\n12) (integer) 2\n13) \"entries\"\n14) 1) 1) \"1638125133432-0\"\n       2) 1) \"foo\"\n          2) \"bar\"\n    2) 1) \"1638125141232-0\"\n       2) 1) \"foo\"\n          2) \"bar2\"\n15) \"groups\"\n16) 1)  1) \"name\"\n        2) \"mygroup\"\n        3) \"last-delivered-id\"\n        4) \"1638125133432-0\"\n        5) \"entries-read\"\n        6) (integer) 1\n        7) \"lag\"\n        8) (integer) 1\n        9) \"pel-count\"\n       10) (integer) 1\n       11) \"pending\"\n       12) 1) 1) \"1638125133432-0\"\n              2) \"Alice\"\n              3) (integer) 1638125153423\n              4) (integer) 1\n       13) \"consumers\"\n       14) 1) 1) \"name\"\n              2) \"Alice\"\n              3) \"seen-time\"\n              4) (integer) 1638125133422\n              5) \"active-time\"\n              6) (integer) 1638125133432\n              7) \"pel-count\"\n              8) (integer) 1\n              9) \"pending\"\n              10) 1) 1) \"1638125133432-0\"\n                     2) (integer) 1638125133432\n                     3) (integer) 1\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.0.0: Added the `FULL` modifier.\n- Starting with Redis version 7.0.0: Added the `max-deleted-entry-id`, `entries-added`, `recorded-first-entry-id`, `entries-read` and `lag` fields\n- Starting with Redis version 7.2.0: Added the `active-time` field, and changed the meaning of `seen-time`.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xinfo-stream/](https://redis.io/commands/xinfo-stream/)"

  summary: 'Time complexity: O(N) with N being the number of elements returned, so asking for a small fixed number of entries per call is O(1)'
  description: "# XPENDING\n\n    XPENDING\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nXPENDING key group [[IDLE min-idle-time] start end count [consumer]]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n5.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N) with N being the number of elements returned, so asking for a small fixed number of entries per call is O(1). O(M), where M is the total number of entries scanned when used with the IDLE filter. When the command returns just the summary and the list of consumers is small, it runs in O(1) time; otherwise, an additional O(N) time for iterating every consumer.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@read`, `@stream`, `@slow`,\n\nFetching data from a stream via a consumer group, and not acknowledging such data, has the effect of creating *pending entries*. This is well explained in the [`XREADGROUP`](../xreadgroup) command, and even better in our [introduction to Redis Streams](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro). The [`XACK`](../xack) command will immediately remove the pending entry from the Pending Entries List (PEL) since once a message is successfully processed, there is no longer need for the consumer group to track it and to remember the current owner of the message.\n\nThe `XPENDING` command is the interface to inspect the list of pending messages, and is as thus a very important command in order to observe and understand what is happening with a streams consumer groups: what clients are active, what messages are pending to be consumed, or to see if there are idle messages. Moreover this command, together with [`XCLAIM`](../xclaim) is used in order to implement recovering of consumers that are failing for a long time, and as a result certain messages are not processed: a different consumer can claim the message and continue. This is better explained in the [streams intro](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro) and in the [`XCLAIM`](../xclaim) command page, and is not covered here.\n\n## Summary form of XPENDING\n\nWhen `XPENDING` is called with just a key name and a consumer group name, it just outputs a summary about the pending messages in a given consumer group. In the following example, we create a consumer group and immediately create a pending message by reading from the group with [`XREADGROUP`](../xreadgroup).\n\n```\n> XGROUP CREATE mystream group55 0-0\nOK\n\n> XREADGROUP GROUP group55 consumer-123 COUNT 1 STREAMS mystream >\n1) 1) \"mystream\"\n   2) 1) 1) 1526984818136-0\n         2) 1) \"duration\"\n            2) \"1532\"\n            3) \"event-id\"\n            4) \"5\"\n            5) \"user-id\"\n            6) \"7782813\"\n```\n\nWe expect the pending entries list for the consumer group `group55` to have a message right now: consumer named `consumer-123` fetched the message without acknowledging its processing. The simple `XPENDING` form will give us this information:\n\n```\n> XPENDING mystream group55\n1) (integer) 1\n2) 1526984818136-0\n3) 1526984818136-0\n4) 1) 1) \"consumer-123\"\n      2) \"1\"\n```\n\nIn this form, the command outputs the total number of pending messages for this consumer group, which is one, followed by the smallest and greatest ID among the pending messages, and then list every consumer in the consumer group with at least one pending message, and the number of pending messages it has.\n\n## Extended form of XPENDING\n\nThe summary provides a good overview, but sometimes we are interested in the details. In order to see all the pending messages with more associated information we need to also pass a range of IDs, in a similar way we do it with [`XRANGE`](../xrange), and a non optional *count* argument, to limit the number of messages returned per call:\n\n```\n> XPENDING mystream group55 - + 10\n1) 1) 1526984818136-0\n   2) \"consumer-123\"\n   3) (integer) 196415\n   4) (integer) 1\n```\n\nIn the extended form we no longer see the summary information, instead there is detailed information for each message in the pending entries list. For each message four attributes are returned:\n\n1.  The ID of the message.\n2.  The name of the consumer that fetched the message and has still to acknowledge it. We call it the current *owner* of the message.\n3.  The number of milliseconds that elapsed since the last time this message was delivered to this consumer.\n4.  The number of times this message was delivered.\n\nThe deliveries counter, that is the fourth element in the array, is incremented when some other consumer *claims* the message with [`XCLAIM`](../xclaim), or when the message is delivered again via [`XREADGROUP`](../xreadgroup), when accessing the history of a consumer in a consumer group (see the [`XREADGROUP`](../xreadgroup) page for more info).\n\nIt is possible to pass an additional argument to the command, in order to see the messages having a specific owner:\n\n```\n> XPENDING mystream group55 - + 10 consumer-123\n```\n\nBut in the above case the output would be the same, since we have pending messages only for a single consumer. However what is important to keep in mind is that this operation, filtering by a specific consumer, is not inefficient even when there are many pending messages from many consumers: we have a pending entries list data structure both globally, and for every consumer, so we can very efficiently show just messages pending for a single consumer.\n\n## Idle time filter\n\nIt is also possible to filter pending stream entries by their idle-time, given in milliseconds (useful for [`XCLAIM`](../xclaim)ing entries that have not been processed for some time):\n\n```\n> XPENDING mystream group55 IDLE 9000 - + 10\n> XPENDING mystream group55 IDLE 9000 - + 10 consumer-123\n```\n\nThe first case will return the first 10 (or less) PEL entries of the entire group that are idle for over 9 seconds, whereas in the second case only those of `consumer-123`.\n\n## Exclusive ranges and iterating the PEL\n\nThe `XPENDING` command allows iterating over the pending entries just like [`XRANGE`](../xrange) and [`XREVRANGE`](../xrevrange) allow for the stream's entries. You can do this by prefixing the ID of the last-read pending entry with the `(` character that denotes an open (exclusive) range, and proving it to the subsequent call to the command.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\nThe command returns data in different format depending on the way it is called, as previously explained in this page. However the reply is always an array of items.\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: Added the `IDLE` option and exclusive range intervals.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xpending/](https://redis.io/commands/xpending/)"

  summary: 'Time complexity: O(N) with N being the number of elements being returned'
  description: "# XRANGE\n\n    XRANGE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nXRANGE key start end [COUNT count]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n5.0.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(N) with N being the number of elements being returned. If N is constant (e.g. always asking for the first 10 elements with COUNT), you can consider it O(1).\n\nACL categories:  \n`@read`, `@stream`, `@slow`,\n\nThe command returns the stream entries matching a given range of IDs. The range is specified by a minimum and maximum ID. All the entries having an ID between the two specified or exactly one of the two IDs specified (closed interval) are returned.\n\nThe `XRANGE` command has a number of applications:\n\n- Returning items in a specific time range. This is possible because Stream IDs are [related to time](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro).\n- Iterating a stream incrementally, returning just a few items at every iteration. However it is semantically much more robust than the [`SCAN`](../scan) family of functions.\n- Fetching a single entry from a stream, providing the ID of the entry to fetch two times: as start and end of the query interval.\n\nThe command also has a reciprocal command returning items in the reverse order, called [`XREVRANGE`](../xrevrange), which is otherwise identical.\n\n## `-` and `+` special IDs\n\nThe `-` and `+` special IDs mean respectively the minimum ID possible and the maximum ID possible inside a stream, so the following command will just return every entry in the stream:\n\n```\n> XRANGE somestream - +\n1) 1) 1526985054069-0\n   2) 1) \"duration\"\n      2) \"72\"\n      3) \"event-id\"\n      4) \"9\"\n      5) \"user-id\"\n      6) \"839248\"\n2) 1) 1526985069902-0\n   2) 1) \"duration\"\n      2) \"415\"\n      3) \"event-id\"\n      4) \"2\"\n      5) \"user-id\"\n      6) \"772213\"\n... other entries here ...\n```\n\nThe `-` and `+` special IDs mean, respectively, the minimal and maximal range IDs, however they are nicer to type.\n\n## Incomplete IDs\n\nStream IDs are composed of two parts, a Unix millisecond time stamp and a sequence number for entries inserted in the same millisecond. It is possible to use `XRANGE` specifying just the first part of the ID, the millisecond time, like in the following example:\n\n```\n> XRANGE somestream 1526985054069 1526985055069\n```\n\nIn this case, `XRANGE` will auto-complete the start interval with `-0` and end interval with `-18446744073709551615`, in order to return all the entries that were generated between a given millisecond and the end of the other specified millisecond. This also means that repeating the same millisecond two times, we get all the entries within such millisecond, because the sequence number range will be from zero to the maximum.\n\nUsed in this way `XRANGE` works as a range query command to obtain entries in a specified time. This is very handy in order to access the history of past events in a stream.\n\n## Exclusive ranges\n\nThe range is close (inclusive) by default, meaning that the reply can include entries with IDs matching the query's start and end intervals. It is possible to specify an open interval (exclusive) by prefixing the ID with the character `(`. This is useful for iterating the stream, as explained below.\n\n## Returning a maximum number of entries\n\nUsing the **COUNT** option it is possible to reduce the number of entries reported. This is a very important feature even if it may look marginal, because it allows, for instance, to model operations such as *give me the entry greater or equal to the following*:\n\n```\n> XRANGE somestream 1526985054069-0 + COUNT 1\n1) 1) 1526985054069-0\n   2) 1) \"duration\"\n      2) \"72\"\n      3) \"event-id\"\n      4) \"9\"\n      5) \"user-id\"\n      6) \"839248\"\n```\n\nIn the above case the entry `1526985054069-0` exists, otherwise the server would have sent us the next one. Using `COUNT` is also the base in order to use `XRANGE` as an iterator.\n\n## Iterating a stream\n\nIn order to iterate a stream, we can proceed as follows. Let's assume that we want two elements per iteration. We start fetching the first two elements, which is trivial:\n\n```\n> XRANGE writers - + COUNT 2\n1) 1) 1526985676425-0\n   2) 1) \"name\"\n      2) \"Virginia\"\n      3) \"surname\"\n      4) \"Woolf\"\n2) 1) 1526985685298-0\n   2) 1) \"name\"\n      2) \"Jane\"\n      3) \"surname\"\n      4) \"Austen\"\n```\n\nThen instead of starting the iteration again from `-`, as the start of the range we use the entry ID of the *last* entry returned by the previous `XRANGE` call as an exclusive interval.\n\nThe ID of the last entry is `1526985685298-0`, so we just prefix it with a '(', and continue our iteration:\n\n```\n> XRANGE writers (1526985685298-0 + COUNT 2\n1) 1) 1526985691746-0\n   2) 1) \"name\"\n      2) \"Toni\"\n      3) \"surname\"\n      4) \"Morrison\"\n2) 1) 1526985712947-0\n   2) 1) \"name\"\n      2) \"Agatha\"\n      3) \"surname\"\n      4) \"Christie\"\n```\n\nAnd so forth. Eventually this will allow to visit all the entries in the stream. Obviously, we can start the iteration from any ID, or even from a specific time, by providing a given incomplete start ID. Moreover, we can limit the iteration to a given ID or time, by providing an end ID or incomplete ID instead of `+`.\n\nThe command [`XREAD`](../xread) is also able to iterate the stream. The command [`XREVRANGE`](../xrevrange) can iterate the stream reverse, from higher IDs (or times) to lower IDs (or times).\n\n### Iterating with earlier versions of Redis\n\nWhile exclusive range intervals are only available from Redis 6.2, it is still possible to use a similar stream iteration pattern with earlier versions. You start fetching from the stream the same way as described above to obtain the first entries.\n\nFor the subsequent calls, you'll need to programmatically advance the last entry's ID returned. Most Redis client should abstract this detail, but the implementation can also be in the application if needed. In the example above, this means incrementing the sequence of `1526985685298-0` by one, from 0 to 1. The second call would, therefore, be:\n\n```\n> XRANGE writers 1526985685298-1 + COUNT 2\n1) 1) 1526985691746-0\n   2) 1) \"name\"\n      2) \"Toni\"\n...\n```\n\nAlso, note that once the sequence part of the last ID equals 18446744073709551615, you'll need to increment the timestamp and reset the sequence part to 0. For example, incrementing the ID `1526985685298-18446744073709551615` should result in `1526985685299-0`.\n\nA symmetrical pattern applies to iterating the stream with [`XREVRANGE`](../xrevrange). The only difference is that the client needs to decrement the ID for the subsequent calls. When decrementing an ID with a sequence part of 0, the timestamp needs to be decremented by 1 and the sequence set to 18446744073709551615.\n\n## Fetching single items\n\nIf you look for an `XGET` command you'll be disappointed because `XRANGE` is effectively the way to go in order to fetch a single entry from a stream. All you have to do is to specify the ID two times in the arguments of XRANGE:\n\n```\n> XRANGE mystream 1526984818136-0 1526984818136-0\n1) 1) 1526984818136-0\n   2) 1) \"duration\"\n      2) \"1532\"\n      3) \"event-id\"\n      4) \"5\"\n      5) \"user-id\"\n      6) \"7782813\"\n```\n\n## Additional information about streams\n\nFor further information about Redis streams please check our [introduction to Redis Streams document](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro).\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\nThe command returns the entries with IDs matching the specified range. The returned entries are complete, that means that the ID and all the fields they are composed are returned. Moreover, the entries are returned with their fields and values in the exact same order as [`XADD`](../xadd) added them.\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nXADD writers * name Virginia surname Woolf\nXADD writers * name Jane surname Austen\nXADD writers * name Toni surname Morrison\nXADD writers * name Agatha surname Christie\nXADD writers * name Ngozi surname Adichie\nXLEN writers\nXRANGE writers - + COUNT 2\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: Added exclusive ranges.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xrange/](https://redis.io/commands/xrange/)"

  summary: Read data from one or multiple streams, only returning entries with an ID greater than the last received ID reported by the caller

This command has an option to block if items are not available, in a similar fashion to [`BRPOP`](../brpop) or [`BZPOPMIN`](../bzpopmin) and others.\n\nPlease note that before reading this page, if you are new to streams, we recommend to read [our introduction to Redis Streams](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro).\n\n## Non-blocking usage\n\nIf the **BLOCK** option is not used, the command is synchronous, and can be considered somewhat related to [`XRANGE`](../xrange): it will return a range of items inside streams, however it has two fundamental differences compared to [`XRANGE`](../xrange) even if we just consider the synchronous usage:\n\n- This command can be called with multiple streams if we want to read at the same time from a number of keys. This is a key feature of `XREAD` because especially when blocking with **BLOCK**, to be able to listen with a single connection to multiple keys is a vital feature.\n- While [`XRANGE`](../xrange) returns items in a range of IDs, `XREAD` is more suited in order to consume the stream starting from the first entry which is greater than any other entry we saw so far. So what we pass to `XREAD` is, for each stream, the ID of the last element that we received from that stream.\n\nFor example, if I have two streams `mystream` and `writers`, and I want to read data from both the streams starting from the first element they contain, I could call `XREAD` like in the following example.\n\nNote: we use the **COUNT** option in the example, so that for each stream the call will return at maximum two elements per stream.\n\n```\n> XREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS mystream writers 0-0 0-0\n1) 1) \"mystream\"\n   2) 1) 1) 1526984818136-0\n         2) 1) \"duration\"\n            2) \"1532\"\n            3) \"event-id\"\n            4) \"5\"\n            5) \"user-id\"\n            6) \"7782813\"\n      2) 1) 1526999352406-0\n         2) 1) \"duration\"\n            2) \"812\"\n            3) \"event-id\"\n            4) \"9\"\n            5) \"user-id\"\n            6) \"388234\"\n2) 1) \"writers\"\n   2) 1) 1) 1526985676425-0\n         2) 1) \"name\"\n            2) \"Virginia\"\n            3) \"surname\"\n            4) \"Woolf\"\n      2) 1) 1526985685298-0\n         2) 1) \"name\"\n            2) \"Jane\"\n            3) \"surname\"\n            4) \"Austen\"\n```\n\nThe **STREAMS** option is mandatory and MUST be the final option because such option gets a variable length of argument in the following format:\n\n    STREAMS key_1 key_2 key_3 ... key_N ID_1 ID_2 ID_3 ... ID_N\n\nSo we start with a list of keys, and later continue with all the associated IDs, representing *the last ID we received for that stream*, so that the call will serve us only greater IDs from the same stream.\n\nFor instance in the above example, the last items that we received for the stream `mystream` has ID `1526999352406-0`, while for the stream `writers` has the ID `1526985685298-0`.\n\nTo continue iterating the two streams I'll call:\n\n```\n> XREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS mystream writers 1526999352406-0 1526985685298-0\n1) 1) \"mystream\"\n   2) 1) 1) 1526999626221-0\n         2) 1) \"duration\"\n            2) \"911\"\n            3) \"event-id\"\n            4) \"7\"\n            5) \"user-id\"\n            6) \"9488232\"\n2) 1) \"writers\"\n   2) 1) 1) 1526985691746-0\n         2) 1) \"name\"\n            2) \"Toni\"\n            3) \"surname\"\n            4) \"Morrison\"\n      2) 1) 1526985712947-0\n         2) 1) \"name\"\n            2) \"Agatha\"\n            3) \"surname\"\n            4) \"Christie\"\n```\n\nAnd so forth. Eventually, the call will not return any item, but just an empty array, then we know that there is nothing more to fetch from our stream (and we would have to retry the operation, hence this command also supports a blocking mode).\n\n## Incomplete IDs\n\nTo use incomplete IDs is valid, like it is valid for [`XRANGE`](../xrange). However here the sequence part of the ID, if missing, is always interpreted as zero, so the command:\n\n```\n> XREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS mystream writers 0 0\n```\n\nis exactly equivalent to\n\n```\n> XREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS mystream writers 0-0 0-0\n```\n\n## Blocking for data\n\nIn its synchronous form, the command can get new data as long as there are more items available. However, at some point, we'll have to wait for producers of data to use [`XADD`](../xadd) to push new entries inside the streams we are consuming. In order to avoid polling at a fixed or adaptive interval the command is able to block if it could not return any data, according to the specified streams and IDs, and automatically unblock once one of the requested keys accept data.\n\nIt is important to understand that this command *fans out* to all the clients that are waiting for the same range of IDs, so every consumer will get a copy of the data, unlike to what happens when blocking list pop operations are used.\n\nIn order to block, the **BLOCK** option is used, together with the number of milliseconds we want to block before timing out. Normally Redis blocking commands take timeouts in seconds, however this command takes a millisecond timeout, even if normally the server will have a timeout resolution near to 0.1 seconds. This time it is possible to block for a shorter time in certain use cases, and if the server internals will improve over time, it is possible that the resolution of timeouts will improve.\n\nWhen the **BLOCK** command is passed, but there is data to return at least in one of the streams passed, the command is executed synchronously *exactly like if the BLOCK option would be missing*.\n\nThis is an example of blocking invocation, where the command later returns a null reply because the timeout has elapsed without new data arriving:\n\n```\n> XREAD BLOCK 1000 STREAMS mystream 1526999626221-0\n(nil)\n```\n\n## The special `$` ID.\n\nWhen blocking sometimes we want to receive just entries that are added to the stream via [`XADD`](../xadd) starting from the moment we block. In such a case we are not interested in the history of already added entries. For this use case, we would have to check the stream top element ID, and use such ID in the `XREAD` command line. This is not clean and requires to call other commands, so instead it is possible to use the special `$` ID to signal the stream that we want only the new things.\n\nIt is **very important** to understand that you should use the `$` ID only for the first call to `XREAD`. Later the ID should be the one of the last reported item in the stream, otherwise you could miss all the entries that are added in between.\n\nThis is how a typical `XREAD` call looks like in the first iteration of a consumer willing to consume only new entries:\n\n```\n> XREAD BLOCK 5000 COUNT 100 STREAMS mystream $\n```\n\nOnce we get some replies, the next call will be something like:\n\n```\n> XREAD BLOCK 5000 COUNT 100 STREAMS mystream 1526999644174-3\n```\n\nAnd so forth.\n\n## How multiple clients blocked on a single stream are served\n\nBlocking list operations on lists or sorted sets have a *pop* behavior. Basically, the element is removed from the list or sorted set in order to be returned to the client. In this scenario you want the items to be consumed in a fair way, depending on the moment clients blocked on a given key arrived. Normally Redis uses the FIFO semantics in this use cases.\n\nHowever note that with streams this is not a problem: stream entries are not removed from the stream when clients are served, so every client waiting will be served as soon as an [`XADD`](../xadd) command provides data to the stream.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\nThe command returns an array of results: each element of the returned array is an array composed of a two element containing the key name and the entries reported for that key. The entries reported are full stream entries, having IDs and the list of all the fields and values. Field and values are guaranteed to be reported in the same order they were added by [`XADD`](../xadd).\n\nWhen **BLOCK** is used, on timeout a null reply is returned.\n\nReading the [Redis Streams introduction](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro) is highly suggested in order to understand more about the streams overall behavior and semantics.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xread/](https://redis.io/commands/xread/)"

If M is constant (e.g. always asking for the first 10 elements with COUNT), you can consider it O(1). On the other side when XREADGROUP blocks, XADD will pay the O(N) time in order to serve the N clients blocked on the stream getting new data.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@stream`, `@slow`, `@blocking`,\n\nThe `XREADGROUP` command is a special version of the [`XREAD`](../xread) command with support for consumer groups. Probably you will have to understand the [`XREAD`](../xread) command before reading this page will makes sense.\n\nMoreover, if you are new to streams, we recommend to read our [introduction to Redis Streams](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro). Make sure to understand the concept of consumer group in the introduction so that following how this command works will be simpler.\n\n## Consumer groups in 30 seconds\n\nThe difference between this command and the vanilla [`XREAD`](../xread) is that this one supports consumer groups.\n\nWithout consumer groups, just using [`XREAD`](../xread), all the clients are served with all the entries arriving in a stream. Instead using consumer groups with `XREADGROUP`, it is possible to create groups of clients that consume different parts of the messages arriving in a given stream. If, for instance, the stream gets the new entries A, B, and C and there are two consumers reading via a consumer group, one client will get, for instance, the messages A and C, and the other the message B, and so forth.\n\nWithin a consumer group, a given consumer (that is, just a client consuming messages from the stream), has to identify with a unique *consumer name*. Which is just a string.\n\nOne of the guarantees of consumer groups is that a given consumer can only see the history of messages that were delivered to it, so a message has just a single owner. However there is a special feature called *message claiming* that allows other consumers to claim messages in case there is a non recoverable failure of some consumer. In order to implement such semantics, consumer groups require explicit acknowledgment of the messages successfully processed by the consumer, via the [`XACK`](../xack) command. This is needed because the stream will track, for each consumer group, who is processing what message.\n\nThis is how to understand if you want to use a consumer group or not:\n\n1.  If you have a stream and multiple clients, and you want all the clients to get all the messages, you do not need a consumer group.\n2.  If you have a stream and multiple clients, and you want the stream to be *partitioned* or *sharded* across your clients, so that each client will get a sub set of the messages arriving in a stream, you need a consumer group.\n\n## Differences between XREAD and XREADGROUP\n\nFrom the point of view of the syntax, the commands are almost the same, however `XREADGROUP` *requires* a special and mandatory option:\n\n    GROUP <group-name> <consumer-name>\n\nThe group name is just the name of a consumer group associated to the stream. The group is created using the [`XGROUP`](../xgroup) command. The consumer name is the string that is used by the client to identify itself inside the group. The consumer is auto created inside the consumer group the first time it is saw. Different clients should select a different consumer name.\n\nWhen you read with `XREADGROUP`, the server will *remember* that a given message was delivered to you: the message will be stored inside the consumer group in what is called a Pending Entries List (PEL), that is a list of message IDs delivered but not yet acknowledged.\n\nThe client will have to acknowledge the message processing using [`XACK`](../xack) in order for the pending entry to be removed from the PEL. The PEL can be inspected using the [`XPENDING`](../xpending) command.\n\nThe `NOACK` subcommand can be used to avoid adding the message to the PEL in cases where reliability is not a requirement and the occasional message loss is acceptable. This is equivalent to acknowledging the message when it is read.\n\nThe ID to specify in the **STREAMS** option when using `XREADGROUP` can be one of the following two:\n\n- The special `>` ID, which means that the consumer want to receive only messages that were *never delivered to any other consumer*. It just means, give me new messages.\n- Any other ID, that is, 0 or any other valid ID or incomplete ID (just the millisecond time part), will have the effect of returning entries that are pending for the consumer sending the command with IDs greater than the one provided. So basically if the ID is not `>`, then the command will just let the client access its pending entries: messages delivered to it, but not yet acknowledged. Note that in this case, both `BLOCK` and `NOACK` are ignored.\n\nLike [`XREAD`](../xread) the `XREADGROUP` command can be used in a blocking way. There are no differences in this regard.\n\n## What happens when a message is delivered to a consumer?\n\nTwo things:\n\n1.  If the message was never delivered to anyone, that is, if we are talking about a new message, then a PEL (Pending Entries List) is created.\n2.  If instead the message was already delivered to this consumer, and it is just re-fetching the same message again, then the *last delivery counter* is updated to the current time, and the *number of deliveries* is incremented by one. You can access those message properties using the [`XPENDING`](../xpending) command.\n\n## Usage example\n\nNormally you use the command like that in order to get new messages and process them. In pseudo-code:\n\n```\nWHILE true\n    entries = XREADGROUP GROUP $GroupName $ConsumerName BLOCK 2000 COUNT 10 STREAMS mystream >\n    if entries == nil\n        puts \"Timeout... try again\"\n        CONTINUE\n    end\n\n    FOREACH entries AS stream_entries\n        FOREACH stream_entries as message\n            process_message(message.id,message.fields)\n\n            # ACK the message as processed\n            XACK mystream $GroupName message.id\n        END\n    END\nEND\n```\n\nIn this way the example consumer code will fetch only new messages, process them, and acknowledge them via [`XACK`](../xack). However the example code above is not complete, because it does not handle recovering after a crash. What will happen if we crash in the middle of processing messages, is that our messages will remain in the pending entries list, so we can access our history by giving `XREADGROUP` initially an ID of 0, and performing the same loop. Once providing an ID of 0 the reply is an empty set of messages, we know that we processed and acknowledged all the pending messages: we can start to use `>` as ID, in order to get the new messages and rejoin the consumers that are processing new things.\n\nTo see how the command actually replies, please check the [`XREAD`](../xread) command page.\n\n## What happens when a pending message is deleted?\n\nEntries may be deleted from the stream due to trimming or explicit calls to [`XDEL`](../xdel) at any time. By design, Redis doesn't prevent the deletion of entries that are present in the stream's PELs. When this happens, the PELs retain the deleted entries' IDs, but the actual entry payload is no longer available. Therefore, when reading such PEL entries, Redis will return a null value in place of their respective data.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n> XADD mystream 1 myfield mydata\n\"1-0\"\n> XGROUP CREATE mystream mygroup 0\nOK\n> XREADGROUP GROUP mygroup myconsumer STREAMS mystream >\n1) 1) \"mystream\"\n   2) 1) 1) \"1-0\"\n         2) 1) \"myfield\"\n            2) \"mydata\"\n> XDEL mystream 1-0\n(integer) 1\n> XREADGROUP GROUP mygroup myconsumer STREAMS mystream 0\n1) 1) \"mystream\"\n   2) 1) 1) \"1-0\"\n         2) (nil)\n```\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays), specifically:\n\nThe command returns an array of results: each element of the returned array is an array composed of a two element containing the key name and the entries reported for that key. The entries reported are full stream entries, having IDs and the list of all the fields and values. Field and values are guaranteed to be reported in the same order they were added by [`XADD`](../xadd).\n\nWhen **BLOCK** is used, on timeout a null reply is returned.\n\nReading the [Redis Streams introduction](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro) is highly suggested in order to understand more about the streams overall behavior and semantics.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xreadgroup/](https://redis.io/commands/xreadgroup/)"

Constant times are very small however, since entries are organized in macro nodes containing multiple entries that can be released with a single deallocation.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@write`, `@stream`, `@slow`,\n\n`XTRIM` trims the stream by evicting older entries (entries with lower IDs) if needed.\n\nTrimming the stream can be done using one of these strategies:\n\n- `MAXLEN`: Evicts entries as long as the stream's length exceeds the specified `threshold`, where `threshold` is a positive integer.\n- `MINID`: Evicts entries with IDs lower than `threshold`, where `threshold` is a stream ID.\n\nFor example, this will trim the stream to exactly the latest 1000 items:\n\n```\nXTRIM mystream MAXLEN 1000\n```\n\nWhereas in this example, all entries that have an ID lower than 649085820-0 will be evicted:\n\n```\nXTRIM mystream MINID 649085820\n```\n\nBy default, or when provided with the optional `=` argument, the command performs exact trimming.\n\nDepending on the strategy, exact trimming means:\n\n- `MAXLEN`: the trimmed stream's length will be exactly the minimum between its original length and the specified `threshold`.\n- `MINID`: the oldest ID in the stream will be exactly the maximum between its original oldest ID and the specified `threshold`.\n\n## Nearly exact trimming\n\nBecause exact trimming may require additional effort from the Redis server, the optional `~` argument can be provided to make it more efficient.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nXTRIM mystream MAXLEN ~ 1000\n```\n\nThe `~` argument between the `MAXLEN` strategy and the `threshold` means that the user is requesting to trim the stream so its length is **at least** the `threshold`, but possibly slightly more. In this case, Redis will stop trimming early when performance can be gained (for example, when a whole macro node in the data structure can't be removed). This makes trimming much more efficient, and it is usually what you want, although after trimming, the stream may have few tens of additional entries over the `threshold`.\n\nAnother way to control the amount of work done by the command when using the `~`, is the `LIMIT` clause. When used, it specifies the maximal `count` of entries that will be evicted. When `LIMIT` and `count` aren't specified, the default value of 100 \\* the number of entries in a macro node will be implicitly used as the `count`. Specifying the value 0 as `count` disables the limiting mechanism entirely.\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers): The number of entries deleted from the stream.\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nXADD mystream * field1 A field2 B field3 C field4 D\nXTRIM mystream MAXLEN 2\nXRANGE mystream - +\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: Added the `MINID` trimming strategy and the `LIMIT` option.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/xtrim/](https://redis.io/commands/xtrim/)"

It is possible to specify multiple score / member pairs. If a specified member is already a member of the sorted set, the score is updated and the element reinserted at the right position to ensure the correct ordering.\n\nIf `key` does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified members as sole members is created, like if the sorted set was empty. If the key exists but does not hold a sorted set, an error is returned.\n\nThe score values should be the string representation of a double precision floating point number. `+inf` and `-inf` values are valid values as well.\n\n## ZADD options\n\nZADD supports a list of options, specified after the name of the key and before the first score argument. Options are:\n\n- **XX**: Only update elements that already exist. Don't add new elements.\n- **NX**: Only add new elements. Don't update already existing elements.\n- **LT**: Only update existing elements if the new score is **less than** the current score. This flag doesn't prevent adding new elements.\n- **GT**: Only update existing elements if the new score is **greater than** the current score. This flag doesn't prevent adding new elements.\n- **CH**: Modify the return value from the number of new elements added, to the total number of elements changed (CH is an abbreviation of *changed*). Changed elements are **new elements added** and elements already existing for which **the score was updated**. So elements specified in the command line having the same score as they had in the past are not counted. Note: normally the return value of `ZADD` only counts the number of new elements added.\n- **INCR**: When this option is specified `ZADD` acts like [`ZINCRBY`](../zincrby). Only one score-element pair can be specified in this mode.\n\nNote: The **GT**, **LT** and **NX** options are mutually exclusive.\n\n## Range of integer scores that can be expressed precisely\n\nRedis sorted sets use a *double 64-bit floating point number* to represent the score. In all the architectures we support, this is represented as an **IEEE 754 floating point number**, that is able to represent precisely integer numbers between `-(2^53)` and `+(2^53)` included. In more practical terms, all the integers between -9007199254740992 and 9007199254740992 are perfectly representable. Larger integers, or fractions, are internally represented in exponential form, so it is possible that you get only an approximation of the decimal number, or of the very big integer, that you set as score.\n\n## Sorted sets 101\n\nSorted sets are sorted by their score in an ascending way. The same element only exists a single time, no repeated elements are permitted. The score can be modified both by `ZADD` that will update the element score, and as a side effect, its position on the sorted set, and by [`ZINCRBY`](../zincrby) that can be used in order to update the score relatively to its previous value.\n\nThe current score of an element can be retrieved using the [`ZSCORE`](../zscore) command, that can also be used to verify if an element already exists or not.\n\nFor an introduction to sorted sets, see the data types page on [sorted sets](https://redis.io/topics/data-types#sorted-sets).\n\n## Elements with the same score\n\nWhile the same element can't be repeated in a sorted set since every element is unique, it is possible to add multiple different elements *having the same score*. When multiple elements have the same score, they are *ordered lexicographically* (they are still ordered by score as a first key, however, locally, all the elements with the same score are relatively ordered lexicographically).\n\nThe lexicographic ordering used is binary, it compares strings as array of bytes.\n\nIf the user inserts all the elements in a sorted set with the same score (for example 0), all the elements of the sorted set are sorted lexicographically, and range queries on elements are possible using the command [`ZRANGEBYLEX`](../zrangebylex) (Note: it is also possible to query sorted sets by range of scores using [`ZRANGEBYSCORE`](../zrangebyscore)).\n\n## Return\n\n[Integer reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-integers), specifically:\n\n- When used without optional arguments, the number of elements added to the sorted set (excluding score updates).\n- If the `CH` option is specified, the number of elements that were changed (added or updated).\n\nIf the [`INCR`](../incr) option is specified, the return value will be [Bulk string reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-bulk-strings):\n\n- The new score of `member` (a double precision floating point number) represented as string, or `nil` if the operation was aborted (when called with either the `XX` or the `NX` option).\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nZADD myzset 1 \"one\"\nZADD myzset 1 \"uno\"\nZADD myzset 2 \"two\" 3 \"three\"\nZRANGE myzset 0 -1 WITHSCORES\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 2.4.0: Accepts multiple elements.\n- Starting with Redis version 3.0.2: Added the `XX`, `NX`, `CH` and `INCR` options.\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: Added the `GT` and `LT` options.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/zadd/](https://redis.io/commands/zadd/)"

  description: "# ZRANGE\n\n    ZRANGE\n\nSyntax\n\n``` command-syntax\nZRANGE key start stop [BYSCORE | BYLEX] [REV] [LIMIT offset count]\n  [WITHSCORES]\n```\n\nAvailable since:  \n1.2.0\n\nTime complexity:  \nO(log(N)+M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and M the number of elements returned.\n\nACL categories:  \n`@read`, `@sortedset`, `@slow`,\n\nReturns the specified range of elements in the sorted set stored at `<key>`.\n\n`ZRANGE` can perform different types of range queries: by index (rank), by the score, or by lexicographical order.\n\nStarting with Redis 6.2.0, this command can replace the following commands: [`ZREVRANGE`](../zrevrange), [`ZRANGEBYSCORE`](../zrangebyscore), [`ZREVRANGEBYSCORE`](../zrevrangebyscore), [`ZRANGEBYLEX`](../zrangebylex) and [`ZREVRANGEBYLEX`](../zrevrangebylex).\n\n## Common behavior and options\n\nThe order of elements is from the lowest to the highest score. Elements with the same score are ordered lexicographically.\n\nThe optional `REV` argument reverses the ordering, so elements are ordered from highest to lowest score, and score ties are resolved by reverse lexicographical ordering.\n\nThe optional `LIMIT` argument can be used to obtain a sub-range from the matching elements (similar to *SELECT LIMIT offset, count* in SQL). A negative `<count>` returns all elements from the `<offset>`. Keep in mind that if `<offset>` is large, the sorted set needs to be traversed for `<offset>` elements before getting to the elements to return, which can add up to O(N) time complexity.\n\nThe optional `WITHSCORES` argument supplements the command's reply with the scores of elements returned. The returned list contains `value1,score1,...,valueN,scoreN` instead of `value1,...,valueN`. Client libraries are free to return a more appropriate data type (suggestion: an array with (value, score) arrays/tuples).\n\n## Index ranges\n\nBy default, the command performs an index range query. The `<start>` and `<stop>` arguments represent zero-based indexes, where `0` is the first element, `1` is the next element, and so on. These arguments specify an **inclusive range**, so for example, `ZRANGE myzset 0 1` will return both the first and the second element of the sorted set.\n\nThe indexes can also be negative numbers indicating offsets from the end of the sorted set, with `-1` being the last element of the sorted set, `-2` the penultimate element, and so on.\n\nOut of range indexes do not produce an error.\n\nIf `<start>` is greater than either the end index of the sorted set or `<stop>`, an empty list is returned.\n\nIf `<stop>` is greater than the end index of the sorted set, Redis will use the last element of the sorted set.\n\n## Score ranges\n\nWhen the `BYSCORE` option is provided, the command behaves like [`ZRANGEBYSCORE`](../zrangebyscore) and returns the range of elements from the sorted set having scores equal or between `<start>` and `<stop>`.\n\n`<start>` and `<stop>` can be `-inf` and `+inf`, denoting the negative and positive infinities, respectively. This means that you are not required to know the highest or lowest score in the sorted set to get all elements from or up to a certain score.\n\nBy default, the score intervals specified by `<start>` and `<stop>` are closed (inclusive). It is possible to specify an open interval (exclusive) by prefixing the score with the character `(`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nZRANGE zset (1 5 BYSCORE\n```\n\nWill return all elements with `1 < score <= 5` while:\n\n```\nZRANGE zset (5 (10 BYSCORE\n```\n\nWill return all the elements with `5 < score < 10` (5 and 10 excluded).\n\n## Reverse ranges\n\nUsing the `REV` option reverses the sorted set, with index 0 as the element with the highest score.\n\nBy default, `<start>` must be less than or equal to `<stop>` to return anything. However, if the `BYSCORE`, or `BYLEX` options are selected, the `<start>` is the highest score to consider, and `<stop>` is the lowest score to consider, therefore `<start>` must be greater than or equal to `<stop>` in order to return anything.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nZRANGE zset 5 10 REV\n```\n\nWill return the elements between index 5 and 10 in the reversed index.\n\n```\nZRANGE zset 10 5 REV BYSCORE\n```\n\nWill return all elements with scores less than 10 and greater than 5.\n\n## Lexicographical ranges\n\nWhen the `BYLEX` option is used, the command behaves like [`ZRANGEBYLEX`](../zrangebylex) and returns the range of elements from the sorted set between the `<start>` and `<stop>` lexicographical closed range intervals.\n\nNote that lexicographical ordering relies on all elements having the same score. The reply is unspecified when the elements have different scores.\n\nValid `<start>` and `<stop>` must start with `(` or `[`, in order to specify whether the range interval is exclusive or inclusive, respectively.\n\nThe special values of `+` or `-` for `<start>` and `<stop>` mean positive and negative infinite strings, respectively, so for instance the command `ZRANGE myzset - + BYLEX` is guaranteed to return all the elements in the sorted set, providing that all the elements have the same score.\n\nThe `REV` options reverses the order of the `<start>` and `<stop>` elements, where `<start>` must be lexicographically greater than `<stop>` to produce a non-empty result.\n\n### Lexicographical comparison of strings\n\nStrings are compared as a binary array of bytes. Because of how the ASCII character set is specified, this means that usually this also have the effect of comparing normal ASCII characters in an obvious dictionary way. However, this is not true if non-plain ASCII strings are used (for example, utf8 strings).\n\nHowever, the user can apply a transformation to the encoded string so that the first part of the element inserted in the sorted set will compare as the user requires for the specific application. For example, if I want to add strings that will be compared in a case-insensitive way, but I still want to retrieve the real case when querying, I can add strings in the following way:\n\n    ZADD autocomplete 0 foo:Foo 0 bar:BAR 0 zap:zap\n\nBecause of the first *normalized* part in every element (before the colon character), we are forcing a given comparison. However, after the range is queried using `ZRANGE ... BYLEX`, the application can display to the user the second part of the string, after the colon.\n\nThe binary nature of the comparison allows to use sorted sets as a general purpose index, for example, the first part of the element can be a 64-bit big-endian number. Since big-endian numbers have the most significant bytes in the initial positions, the binary comparison will match the numerical comparison of the numbers. This can be used in order to implement range queries on 64-bit values. As in the example below, after the first 8 bytes, we can store the value of the element we are indexing.\n\n## Return\n\n[Array reply](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays): list of elements in the specified range (optionally with their scores, in case the `WITHSCORES` option is given).\n\n## Examples\n\n``` redis-cli\nZADD myzset 1 \"one\"\nZADD myzset 2 \"two\"\nZADD myzset 3 \"three\"\nZRANGE myzset 0 -1\nZRANGE myzset 2 3\nZRANGE myzset -2 -1\n```\n\nThe following example using `WITHSCORES` shows how the command returns always an array, but this time, populated with *element_1*, *score_1*, *element_2*, *score_2*, ..., *element_N*, *score_N*.\n\n``` redis-cli\nZRANGE myzset 0 1 WITHSCORES\n```\n\nThis example shows how to query the sorted set by score, excluding the value `1` and up to infinity, returning only the second element of the result:\n\n``` redis-cli\nZRANGE myzset (1 +inf BYSCORE LIMIT 1 1\n```\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 6.2.0: Added the `REV`, `BYSCORE`, `BYLEX` and `LIMIT` options.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/zrange/](https://redis.io/commands/zrange/)"

A negative `count` returns all elements from the `offset`. Keep in mind that if `offset` is large, the sorted set needs to be traversed for `offset` elements before getting to the elements to return, which can add up to O(N) time complexity.\n\nThe optional `WITHSCORES` argument makes the command return both the element and its score, instead of the element alone.

You compute the sum of the weights, which is 1+2+3 = 6\n\nAt this point you add all the elements into a sorted set using this algorithm:\n\n```\nSUM = ELEMENTS.TOTAL_WEIGHT // 6 in this case.\nSCORE = 0\nFOREACH ELE in ELEMENTS\n    SCORE += ELE.weight / SUM\n    ZADD KEY SCORE ELE\nEND\n```\n\nThis means that you set:\n\n```\nA to score 0.16\nB to score .5\nC to score 1\n```\n\nSince this involves approximations, in order to avoid C is set to, like, 0.998 instead of 1, we just modify the above algorithm to make sure the last score is 1 (left as an exercise for the reader...).\n\nAt this point, each time you want to get a weighted random element, just compute a random number between 0 and 1 (which is like calling `rand()` in most languages), so you can just do:\n\n    RANDOM_ELE = ZRANGEBYSCORE key RAND() +inf LIMIT 0 1\n\n## History\n\n- Starting with Redis version 2.0.0: Added the `WITHSCORES` modifier.\n\n© 2006–2022 Salvatore Sanfilippo  \nLicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0.  \n[https://redis.io/commands/zrangebyscore/](https://redis.io/commands/zrangebyscore/)"
